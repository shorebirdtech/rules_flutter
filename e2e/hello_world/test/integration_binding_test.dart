// package:integration_test, built from the pinned Flutter source, compiles and
// its binding runs under flutter_tester.
//
// `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is what every
// integration test calls first; pumping a widget afterwards shows the binding
// drives frames. The property is that the package is usable at all: a Flutter
// SDK package that `flutter pub get` writes into the lock as `source: sdk` is a
// library a test can depend on, not an entry the hub merely lists.
