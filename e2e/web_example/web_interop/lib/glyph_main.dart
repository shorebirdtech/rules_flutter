// An app whose icons come from three different places, so a release build has
// to find each of them to keep it in the shipped icon font:
//
//  - `Icons.home`, drawn here;
//  - the icon of `platformIcon`, which `platform_icon_web.dart` and
//    `platform_icon_stub.dart` define differently, so which one this app
//    draws depends on the platform it is compiled for;
//  - `IconPlugin.shown`, set by a web plugin that nothing in this file
//    imports: only the generated plugin registrant reaches it.
//
// `Icons.ac_unit` is in none of them and must not be kept.
