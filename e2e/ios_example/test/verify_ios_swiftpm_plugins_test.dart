/// Verifies that an Apple plugin is built as its `Package.swift` says.
///
/// `flutter_qjs_next` 1.5.2 compiles QuickJS's C sources, and its manifest
/// sets `CONFIG_VERSION` to `"2026-06-04"`, which QuickJS prints in its memory
/// report, and, in debug builds only, `DUMP_LEAKS`, which compiles in the leak
/// report. The simulator build is a debug build, so the app carries the C
/// code, the version string and the leak report.
///
/// `video_player_avfoundation` 2.12.3's product is its Swift target, which
/// depends on an Objective-C target, which depends on a target for iOS and one
/// for macOS: the app carries the code of each target for iOS, and not the
/// macOS one's.
///
/// `firebase_core` 5.1.0's product is its Swift target and an Objective-C
/// target, and depends on `firebase-ios-sdk`, a remote Swift package that the
/// workspace's `Package.resolved` pins: the app carries both targets and the
/// Firebase SDK's code.
///
/// `libremidi_flutter` 0.9.0 is an FFI plugin (`ffiPlugin: true`, no plugin
/// class) whose Swift package compiles its C++: the app carries the functions
/// Dart looks up.
///
/// `script_phase_plugin` (a path package here) has a Package.swift and a
/// podspec that runs a script phase; Flutter builds it from the Package.swift,
/// and so the app carries its plugin class.
///
/// `swift6_plugin` (a path package) is `swift-tools-version: 6.0` and its
/// source does not compile in the Swift 5 language mode: the app carries it.
///
/// `ffi_dynamic_plugin` (a path package) is an FFI plugin whose product is
/// `.dynamic`: the app carries its C function.
///
/// `resource_plugin` (a path package) has a resource, `greeting.txt`, which
/// SwiftPM bundles as `resource_plugin_resource_plugin.bundle`: the app
/// carries the bundle and the file in it. Its Objective-C target
/// `resource_plugin_objc` has a resource of its own, which it reads through
/// `SWIFTPM_MODULE_BUNDLE`: the app carries that bundle and the class too.
