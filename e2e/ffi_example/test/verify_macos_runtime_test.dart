/// Runtime verification on macOS: launches the bundled .app's binary and
/// asserts all three native-library mechanisms actually worked at runtime.
/// This is a *behavioral* check covering:
///
///  * Native Assets: `add()` binds via `@Native` — the pass depends on the
///    kernel-embedded --native-assets mapping resolving the asset id to the
///    bundled loose `libadd.dylib` in Contents/Frameworks.
///  * native_deps: `mul()` raw-opens `libmul.dylib` by filename, proving the
///    loose-library pipeline bundles where the loader expects.
///  * curated code asset: sqlite3's `@Native` bindings resolve against
///    the bundled libsqlite3.dylib, which nothing in this workspace names —
///    the app depends on drift, and the registry attaches the library to
///    package:sqlite3.
///  * one library for two ids: the app serves `package:count_a` and
///    `package:count_b` from one `libcounter.dylib`, and a count bumped through
///    each reads 2 only if both reached one loaded image of it.
///
/// The binary is launched directly (not via `open`) with TMPDIR pointed at a
/// directory this test controls, so the marker the app writes in main() lands
/// somewhere we can poll deterministically. Tagged "manual"/"exclusive" (like
/// macos_example's verify_macos_app_test) because the engine needs a GUI
/// session. Run explicitly:
///   bazel test :verify_macos_runtime_test --test_tag_filters= \
///     --strategy=TestRunner=standalone
///
/// Pass criteria: the app writes
/// `ffi_example_result add(3,4)=7 mul(3,4)=12 sqlite=HELLO shared=2
/// negate(5)=-5` to `$TMPDIR/ffi_result.txt`.
