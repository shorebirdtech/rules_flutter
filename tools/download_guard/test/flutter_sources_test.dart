/// No download in rules_flutter's own repository rules can fetch bytes it has

/// The property: every `repository_ctx.download*` call in `//flutter` passes a

/// is written as one or because it is a lookup that defaults to one. An empty
/// digest turns Bazel's check off without a word, so a table entry that is
/// missing, or a version nobody added to the table, would download unverified
/// bytes. A missing digest has to stop the fetch instead.
///
/// The sources are found by walking every `.bzl` under `//flutter` that the
/// BUILD file hands this test, so a download added to any of them is checked
/// without being listed here. What the digests *contain* is
/// `//flutter/tests:download_digests_test`; what a fetch *does* with a missing
/// one is `tools/dev_tool/test/e2e/digest_missing_e2e_test.dart`.
