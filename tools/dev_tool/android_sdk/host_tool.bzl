"""`host_tool`: a tool built for the machine Bazel runs on, whatever the build's own platforms.

`flutter_bazel` runs `adb` and `aapt2` itself, on this machine. It builds them
in the same `bazel build` options as the app it runs, because a command whose
options differ from the one before throws the analysis cache away, and the
next build of the app then analyses its whole graph again. Those options can
name any `--platforms`, so the tool's edge moves to the host platform here
rather than through the command line.

The host, not an execution platform: an execution platform can be a remote
worker's, and these run where the dev tool does.
