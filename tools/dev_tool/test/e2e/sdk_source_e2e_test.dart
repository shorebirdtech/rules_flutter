/// A Flutter SDK package of the lock is fetched from the pinned Flutter source.

/// **The property:** `flutter_pub_package` with `flutter_source_version` set
/// builds a package out of `packages/<name>` of the Flutter source tarball, and
/// the package's files are at the repository's root as a hosted package's are.
/// Only that package is extracted: nothing else of `packages/` is in the
/// repository. A lock that lists an `sdk: flutter` package the release's
/// source does not have (one not in `flutter_source_packages`, the list
/// versions.bzl records per release) fails the fetch, naming the package, the
/// Flutter version and the command that re-resolves the lock, instead of
/// Bazel's message about archive prefixes.
///
/// The tarball is served from a distdir, as in `digest_probe.dart`, under the
/// name GitHub's tag archive has, so no network is involved.
