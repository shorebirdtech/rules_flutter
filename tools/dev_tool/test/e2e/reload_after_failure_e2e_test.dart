/// End-to-end: a session survives a failed hot reload.
///
/// Every assertion here is about a command ANSWERING. The reload in the middle
/// is *expected* to report failure — the app really is broken by then — and
/// that is not what this covers. What it covers is that it answers at all, and
/// that a restart afterwards still recovers the session. An unread `reject`
/// response desynchronises the compiler pipe, and every command behind it then
/// queues on the `Pool(1)` permit with no error and no output.
///
/// Driven against the codegen app because its reload path is the widest one: a
/// bazel build for regenerated sources, then the resident compiler.
///
/// The restart-then-`app.waitFor` pair at the end carries a second guard: this
/// is the only automated run in which a SOURCE-ASSEMBLED app is hot-restarted.
/// That is the one configuration where the dev compiler's `file://` `--source`
/// for the generated plugin registrant meets a mounted multi-root file system
/// (see the `dartPluginRegistrantUri:` comment in
/// `native_pipeline_assembler.dart`), and only extensions that registrant
/// brought up can answer an `app.*` command in the fresh isolate. Weakening
/// that assertion to something the framework answers on its own would silently
/// drop the coverage.
/// A reload of this app runs a bazel build (regenerated sources, then the
/// bundle's cquery) before it compiles, so under a loaded machine it
/// legitimately takes longer than the harness's 60s default. A reload that is
/// really wedged still fails, at three minutes.
