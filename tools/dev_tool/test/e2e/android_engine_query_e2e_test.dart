/// Tooling that loads a whole workspace works without the workspace naming the

/// `flutter_android_engine` picks the engine of the platform it is built for
/// with a `select()` over one repository per ABI. A build resolves only the
/// chosen branch, but `bazel query 'deps(//...)'` (and the IDE and
/// dependency-graph tooling built on it) loads every branch, so a repository
/// that only the user's own `use_repo` made visible fails the query with "No
/// repository visible as '@flutter_android_engine_x64'". The engine
/// repositories belong to rules_flutter's extension: rules_flutter resolves
/// them itself, and a user's `use_repo` of them is never required.
///
/// The workspace is queried with `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` set, as
/// every Android check here is: without an SDK, rules_android declares no
/// `androidsdk` targets and a query fails for that reason instead.
///
/// This runs the query in `e2e/hello_world`, whose `MODULE.bazel` must not
/// name every ABI's engine (the guard below), so a query that passes proves
/// the labels resolve from somewhere other than the user's module.
