/// Pub inputs rules_flutter cannot honour must not become a quiet, degraded

///
/// Three properties, each quantified over several inputs so that a different
/// bug breaking the same promise fails too:
///
///  1. **Refuse what cannot be honoured, loudly.** A pub input rules_flutter
///     cannot build exactly as `flutter` would (an asset transformer it does
///     not run, a file name it cannot put in a BUILD file, a lock entry it has
///     no repository for) fails with a message that names the package and the
///     input, while the repository is fetched or, for a lock entry nothing
///     has to use, when something depends on it. It never yields a green
///     build of something else. Where rules_flutter can honour the input
///     instead, that is as good: every test accepts "builds, and the input is
///     there" as well.
///  2. **A repository rule re-runs when anything it read, or looked for,
///     changes.** Adding an overlay file the rule looked for and did not find
///     is a change.
///  3. **Running pub through Bazel leaves the user's HOME alone.**
///
/// The workspaces are generated (`pub_inputs_fixture.dart`): a real
/// `flutter.pub()` hub over packages served from `file://`.
