"""Flutter rules for macOS desktop builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_macos_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:macos.bzl", "flutter_macos_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_macos_app(
            name = "my_app_macos",
            application = ":my_app",
            bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
            app_name = "My App",
        )

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=macos .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `macos/Runner/` directory with AppDelegate.swift,
    MainFlutterWindow.swift, MainMenu.xib, and Info.plist.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

    """Builds a Flutter macOS .app bundle from a flutter_application target.

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `macos/Runner/` directory
    (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=macos .`) and wires up all
    internal targets automatically.

    Prerequisites — the package must contain:
        - `macos/Runner/*.swift` (AppDelegate, MainFlutterWindow, etc.)
        - `macos/Runner/Base.lproj/MainMenu.xib`
        - `macos/Runner/Info.plist`
        - `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements`, `Release.entitlements`
    Generate these with: `flutter create --platforms=macos .`

    Entitlements differ between debug and release, and that is a property of
    the `flutter create` scaffold rather than of these rules. `flutter
    create` writes `com.apple.security.network.server` and
    `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` into **DebugProfile.entitlements
    only**; `Release.entitlements` declares nothing but
    `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`. The macro selects between the two by
    compilation mode, so a sandboxed `-c opt` bundle has neither
    `network.server` nor `network.client` — the sandbox denies the socket
    with no build error and no runtime exception, and a networked app simply
    finds no peers. (`network.client` is absent from *both* files: most
    Flutter apps network through `NSURLSession`, which the sandbox exempts.
    A raw socket is not exempt.)

    Use `additional_entitlements` for any capability the app itself needs:
    additions are merged into whichever base the compilation mode selected,
    so one declaration covers both. Reach for `entitlements` only to replace
    the selection wholesale.

    Args:
        name: Target name (Bazel identifier). The runner's Swift module name
            is derived from it, so it must be a bare Swift identifier.
        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        bundle_id: CFBundleIdentifier (required — rules_apple constraint).
        app_name: User-facing display name (menu bar, window title). Defaults to name.
        minimum_os_version: Minimum macOS version.
        info_plist: Override conventional macos/Runner/Info.plist.
            The plist leaves `CFBundleShortVersionString` and
            `CFBundleVersion` to the app's version: a literal value there
            fails the build, and `$(FLUTTER_BUILD_NAME)` and
            `$(FLUTTER_BUILD_NUMBER)`, as `flutter create` writes them, or
            no key at all, pass.
        version: An `apple_bundle_version` (or `flutter_apple_bundle_version`)
            target, rules_apple's own way to set the version, for example
            from `--embed_label`. Setting it with `build_name` or
            `build_number` is an error.
        build_name: CFBundleShortVersionString, as `flutter build
            --build-name`: numbers separated by periods, padded to three
            as `flutter build` pads them (`2.1` is `2.1.0`). Defaults to
            `1.0.0`. May be a `select()`, whose `None` is the default.
            Unset, the `application`'s `build_name`. Set, the
            `application` must set the same.
        build_number: CFBundleVersion, as `flutter build --build-number`:
            numbers separated by periods. Defaults to `1`. May be a
            `select()`.
            Unset, the `application`'s `build_number`. Set, the
            `application` must set the same.
        additional_contents: Extra content for the bundle (merged with Flutter defaults).
        entitlements: Override entitlements wiring. By default the macro
            auto-discovers `macos/Runner/{DebugProfile,Release}.entitlements`
            (both files are required when this attribute is unset; their
            absence indicates a misconfigured runner). Pass a label to
            override, or a `select()` literal to control per-config
            selection yourself.
        additional_entitlements: Entitlement plist files merged into the
            base entitlements in **every** compilation mode — the additive
            seam for an app that needs one more `com.apple.security.*` key
            without taking over the `flutter create` files. A key the base
            already declares with the same value is deduped; a different
            value is a hard error naming the key and both files. Compose
            `flutter_entitlements_merge` directly for anything more.
        app_icons: The app icon, as the files of an `.appiconset` or of an
            Icon Composer `.icon` bundle. Defaults to the conventional
            `macos/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` that
            `flutter create` writes — so an app that has never thought about
            this ships the icon it already has on disk, which is what
            `flutter build macos` does with the same tree. Pass a list to
            name a different one; pass `[]` to ship no icon. rules_apple
            refuses an `.appiconset` and a `.icon` bundle together, so name
            exactly one.
            Discovery is per-platform and its absence is silent: a tree
            that only ever ran `flutter create --platforms=ios .` has no
            catalog here, and an app with neither a catalog nor an
            `app_icons` has said nothing either way, so it ships no icon and
            there is nothing to report.
        resources: Extra resources. MainMenu.xib is wired separately, through
            the runner library, so that ibtool resolves its Swift classes
            against the runner's module. Resources passed here are compiled
            against the app target's name instead, which is not a module any
            target produces — so a XIB listed here cannot reference the
            runner's Swift classes (an `@objc` class name works regardless).
        runner_deps: Extra `swift_library` labels to link into the runner, so
            the runner's sources can `import` them and the binary carries
            their code. Added to the generated `__<name>_runner` library's
            `deps`; `deps` itself is the macro's and cannot be passed through
            **kwargs. For App Intents, pass the library here *and* to
            rules_apple's `app_intents` (which passes through **kwargs):
            `app_intents` only extracts the metadata, it does not link.
        swift_package_environment: The environment in which the
            `Package.swift` of each plugin that decides its defines from the
            app is evaluated, as the shell's environment is under `flutter
            build`: `{"AUDIO_SESSION_MICROPHONE": "1"}` for what
            audio_session's README says to export. Such a manifest is
            evaluated for this app, also seeing the app's Info.plist (see
            the README's "Apple plugins built from their Package.swift").
            Nothing else reads it, and the shell's environment does not
            reach the manifests.
        **kwargs: Passed through to macos_application, except `target_compatible_with`
            and `visibility`, which are the named target's, and `testonly`, which
            every target the macro declares has, since one that depends on a
            `testonly` application would otherwise fail analysis. The app is
            compatible with macOS only, whatever `target_compatible_with`
            adds, so `bazel build //...` skips it on any other platform. The
            macro sets `app_icons` itself, so pass the named parameter
            instead.

    #    match the module the classes were compiled into, AppKit silently
    #    instantiates a plain NSWindow — blank window, no error.

    #       derives that from the resource's owner: a XIB reached through a
    #       swift_library's `data` is bucketed with that library's own
    #       module_name (resource_aspect.bzl), so attaching the XIB to
    #       __<name>_runner below makes ibtool's --module follow the runner
    #       structurally, with no name to keep in sync by hand.
    #
    #    b) Rewriting the literal customModule covers XIBs that dropped the
    #       provider attribute and hardcode customModule="Runner". Harmless
    #       when the provider is present, since the provider wins.
