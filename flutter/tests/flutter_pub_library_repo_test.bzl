"""Unit tests for the library repository of a built pub package.

A package's library is its dependency cycle built as one target (Bazel has no
cycles; pub does). What is decided here, away from a fetch: which repository
and target another package depends on, what the library's BUILD file says,
and that an overlay cannot be part of a cycle.
