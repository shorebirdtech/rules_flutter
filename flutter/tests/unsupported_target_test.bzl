"""A build for a target rules_flutter does not support fails saying why.

An x86_64 iOS simulator, which an Intel Mac runs, has no Flutter toolchain. The
registry registers a toolchain for it whose analysis fails with rules_flutter's
message, so a build stops on that rather than on Bazel's "No matching toolchains
found". (An analysis test cannot observe the failure through a dependent: a
failing dependency fails the test's own build. So the two halves are checked
apart.)
