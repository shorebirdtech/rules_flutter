"""flutter_pub_package — the `flutter pub get` analog for a single hosted
Flutter pub.dev package, a git package at its locked commit, a `path` package
named in `build_from_pubspec`, or a Flutter SDK package built from the pinned
Flutter source.

For each such package in a Flutter app's pubspec.lock this rule:
  1. Downloads the same `pub.dev/api/packages/<name>/versions/<version>.tar.gz`
     archive, checked against `pubspec.lock`'s digest, that rules_dart's
     `pub_lock_package` would (through the shared `fetch_pub_archive`). A
     Flutter SDK package (`sdk: flutter` in the lock: `flutter_test`,
     `integration_test`, `flutter_driver`, ...) has no archive: with
     `flutter_source_version` set, its tree is `packages/<name>` of the
     toolchain's pinned Flutter source tarball, checked against that
     tarball's recorded digest. A git package (`source: git`) is fetched at the
     lock's `resolved-ref` by rules_dart's `fetch_pub_git`, which lays out its
     directory of the repository exactly as pub does. A `path` package
     (`directory` set) is its directory, linked (`fetch_local_package`).
     Everything after this step is the same.
  2. Reads the package's pubspec.yaml, as pub does (rules_dart's `read_pubspec`).
  3. Projects `flutter.plugin.platforms` via `flutter_plugin_block`.
  4. Finds each Apple platform's library: the plugin's `Package.swift`
     (`<platform>/<pkg>/`, or `darwin/<pkg>/` with `sharedDarwinSource`), or
     without one its CocoaPods source layout (shared-darwin
     `darwin/Classes/`, legacy `<platform>/Classes/`). The plugin's Apple
     repository (`apple_plugin_repo.bzl`) builds those libraries.
  5. Branches on what the pubspec declares:
       - Nothing of Flutter's → emit rules_dart's `pub_package_member`.
         Pure-Dart pub packages reach consumers exactly as they do under
         `pub.pub()`.
       - A `flutter.plugin` block, or fonts, assets, shaders or
         `uses-material-design` → emit a `flutter_pub_member`, a plugin when
         the block is there, with a `flutter_plugin_platform` for each of
         `flutter.plugin.platforms.<plat>`, holding its registration and its
         native library: for iOS and macOS, `<pkg>_apple_<plat>` of the
         plugin's Apple repository.
  6. Records the names the pubspec depends on, and the kind of member this is
     (`flutter_pub_index.bzl`), for the package's library repository.

This repository is the package's *source*: its files and the facts it states
about itself. Its *library*, the target other packages depend on, is made by
`flutter_pub_library_repo` over the members of the package's dependency cycle,
which is why a member has no dependencies of its own.

This is the rules_flutter sibling of rules_dart's `pub_lock_package`. The two
rules never run for the same package: `flutter_pub.from_lock()` always invokes
this one for hosted pub packages; `pub.pub()` (in non-Flutter modules) keeps
using `pub_lock_package`. Both fetch and lay out the archive with rules_dart's
`fetch_pub_archive`, so one package version is the same tree whichever rule asks
for it.

    """Generate `android/BUILD.bazel` content for a Flutter plugin spoke.

    Emits a `kt_android_library(name = "lib", ...)`, which the spoke's member
    lists under `exports` on Android. The spoke of a package with no Android
    sources or resources has no such package.

    Loaded lazily — Bazel only parses this file when an Android build
    analyses the member's `exports`. Non-Android workspaces never trigger
    it and don't pay the `@rules_android` / `@rules_kotlin` cost.

    `@rules_flutter//flutter/private/android:plugin_engine`, one target every
    plugin shares, gives the plugin's Kotlin/Java source access to
    the FlutterPlugin SPI on the compile classpath. It is `neverlink`, as
    Gradle gives a plugin the embedding with `compileOnly`: the app
    packages its own engine, of each ABI of
    `--@rules_android//flags:android_platforms`. The plugin's is the
    arm64 one whatever the app's ABI, since Java bytecode is
    ABI-independent, and packaged it would put an arm64 engine in an x64
    APK. The engine also exports the embedding's
    androidx dependencies (see `_ANDROIDX_EMBEDDING_DEPS` in
    `flutter/android.bzl`), so a plugin whose `build.gradle` declares no
    dependencies still compiles against `NotificationCompat` & co. —
    exactly the compile classpath Gradle gives it via the
    `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_*` POM.

    BuildConfig.java is generated from the plugin's `java_package`. Many
    Flutter plugins reference `BuildConfig.DEBUG`, which Gradle synthesizes
    automatically; rules_android does not. `android_build_config` emits it
    into the library's `srcs`, as Gradle compiles it with the module, with `DEBUG` and `BUILD_TYPE` as Gradle's would be in the build's mode
    (debug: true and `debug`, profile: true and `profile`, release: false
    and `release`).

    Args:
        android_src_dir: Source dir under the package root (e.g.
            `android/src/main`) when the spoke has Android sources, or
            empty when it doesn't.
        java_package: The plugin's Android namespace — resolved the way
            AGP resolves it (`android.namespace` in `build.gradle(.kts)`,
            else the manifest's `package` attribute), falling back to
            `flutter.plugin.platforms.android.package` from the spoke's
            pubspec.yaml. Used as `custom_package` on the
            `kt_android_library` so the generated `R` and `BuildConfig`
            classes land in the package the plugin's sources expect.
        maven_deps: The plugin's Maven dependencies as declared in its
            `build.gradle*`: dicts with `kind` (`"deps"`, `"compile_only"`,
            `"runtime"`), `coordinate` (`group:artifact`), `version` (string
            or None) and `line`. When non-empty the generated library depends
            on the artifacts `@rules_flutter_maven` resolved. One it lacks is
            left out, so that the application's `flutter_android_plugin_libs`
            reports it, by name, with the rest the app needs, rather than
            Bazel failing on a label that does not exist.
        annotated_deps: Labels of `@rules_flutter_maven` artifacts the root's
            `flutter_pub.annotation` adds to the library's `deps`, for what
            the plugin's Gradle build declares in a form the reader does not
            read.
        android_manifest: Path to the plugin's
            `android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` if it ships one, or
            empty. When set, the generated `kt_android_library` declares
            `manifest = ...` so `android_binary`'s manifest merger
            (`ManifestMerger2`) picks the plugin's `<activity>` /
            `<service>` / `<uses-permission>` / etc. entries up
            transitively — same shape AGP uses inside `flutter build apk`.
        consumer_proguard_specs: Paths (relative to the spoke's
            `android/` sub-package) to ProGuard / R8 keep-rule files
            the plugin declared via `consumerProguardFiles` in its
            `build.gradle`. Threaded through as `proguard_specs = [...]`
            on the generated `kt_android_library`; rules_android
            propagates them transitively to the consuming
            `android_binary`'s R8 invocation, mirroring AGP's
            `consumerProguardFiles` flow.
        has_resources: True when the plugin ships resources at
            `android/src/main/res/`. Compiled via `resource_files` so the
            plugin's `R` class is generated against `java_package` and
            the resources merge into the consuming APK.

    Walks the version-specificity ladder
    `<major>.<minor>.<patch>/`, `<major>.<minor>/`, `<major>/`, bare
    `<package>/`, and returns the templated content (with
    `{PKG}`, `{VERSION}`, `{LANGUAGE_VERSION}` and `{DEPS}` substitutions
    applied) on first match. Returns empty string when no template is found.

    `dep_labels` is a function of no arguments, giving the labels of the
    libraries the package's own pubspec resolves to,
    which `{DEPS}` expands into. `guard_hub_deps` rejects a template that
    hand-writes those labels instead — see `find_hardcoded_hub_dep`. Only the
    top-level BUILD sets it: `{DEPS}` is a Dart dependency list, so it is not
    the right substitute for a sibling label in an `android/` sub-package. It
    also requires `{LICENSE}`, the package's licence, which a template that
    leaves it out would drop from every program's `NOTICES`.

    Currently called for two relpaths:

    * `BUILD.bazel.tpl` — the spoke's top-level BUILD that fully
      replaces the auto-generated content.
    * `android/BUILD.bazel.tpl` — the Android sub-package BUILD,
      replacing the empty-stub `kt_android_library(srcs=[])` that
      otherwise fires when a top-level overlay short-circuits the
      regular auto-gen path. Plugins whose Android side needs real
      sources, or Maven deps the Gradle script declares in a form
      rules_flutter cannot read, ship this alongside the top-level
      overlay.
