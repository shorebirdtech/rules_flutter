"""Reconciling a package that several `flutter_pub.from_lock()` locks list.

There is one repository per package for the whole build, so when more than one
lock lists a package they must agree on what it is. `reconcile_package` decides,
from the entries every lock has for the package, which one the build uses, or
why none can be. A hosted package's version is chosen by rules_dart's policy
(`select_pub_version`): every lock's entry is a minimum and the highest wins.

Every function here is pure and returns messages instead of calling `fail`: a
unit test cannot catch `fail`. The extension joins the messages and fails.

An entry is a `struct` the extension makes of one lock entry:

* `kind`: its `lock_entry_kind`;
* `version`, `sha256`, `url` (the registry's), for a hosted package;
* `git_url`, `resolved_ref`, `git_path`, `git_lock` (the lock's label when the
  url is relative to it, else `""`), for a git package;
* `directory` (absolute), for a `path` package built from its pubspec;
* `reason`, for an ignored `path` package;
* `hub`, `lock_label`: the tag it came from;
* `module`, `is_root`: the module whose tag it is, and whether that is the root;
* `lock_dir`: the lock's directory within its repository (its Bazel package).
