"""The `flutter_pub.cycle()` declarations every library repository plans against.

Pub allows packages to depend on each other in a cycle; Bazel does not, so the
packages of one are built as one library, and only where the cycle is
declared. The root module decides: each of its declarations must be exactly a
cycle at the versions the build fetches, or the build fails. Other modules'
declarations, and rules_dart's curated ones (`curated_cycles()`), apply where
they are exactly a cycle and are inert where they are not. Whether a
declaration is a cycle is known only once its packages' pubspecs are read, in
the library repository (`dependency_cycle()`); what is checked here is what is
known before: its form, and that the root's name packages the build builds.
