"""The run half of a Flutter test: runs a compiled test program under flutter_tester.

`flutter_program_test` takes any target that provides `FlutterTestProgramInfo`
(`flutter_suite_program` is one) and runs it as a Bazel test. It speaks the same
`package:test_api` `RemoteListener` protocol `flutter test` does and reports
through the Bazel test protocol: the XML report, JUnit, `@Tags` selection
(`include_tags`, `exclude_tags`, `DART_TEST_TAGS`), golden comparison,
`--update-goldens` under `bazel run`, sharding and coverage.

The rule is bound to the name `flutter_test` here, and not to
`flutter_program_test`, so that `kind(flutter_test, ...)` finds every test
`flutter_test` and `flutter_program_test` declare, as `ios_unit_test` is found
for the tests rules_apple's macro builds from two rules.
