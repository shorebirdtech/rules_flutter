"""Saying how each `path` package of a lock is built, or that it is not.

`flutter_pub.from_lock(resolve = {name: label})` names, for a package of the
lock, the target that builds it. Every `path` entry of the lock must be named in
exactly one of three attributes: `resolve`, the target that builds it;
`build_from_pubspec`, to build its directory from its pubspec as a hosted
package is built; or `ignored`, with the reason no Bazel build may contain it.
A hosted, git or sdk entry may be mapped too, to replace the locked
package for the whole graph with a fork or a patched copy: the hub's label for
the package is the target, so a hosted package that depends on it gets it, and
the locked package is not fetched.

Where a `path` entry points is pub's concern only: the map already says where
Bazel gets the package, which may be another module (a sibling checkout pub
reads by path and Bazel takes from a `bazel_dep`). What holds the mapping to the
lock is that the target declares the package's name, checked at analysis
(`resolved_package.bzl`).

The checks here are pure and run when the extension reads the lock, so a wrong
map fails every Bazel command that loads the module, naming the lock, the
package and the fix. Every function returns messages and never calls `fail`:
a unit test cannot catch `fail`.
