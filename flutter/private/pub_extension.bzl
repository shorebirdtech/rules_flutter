"""The implementation of the `pub` extension (`@rules_flutter//flutter/pub:extensions.bzl`).

It resolves pub dependencies (including Flutter SDK packages like package:flutter)
from `pubspec.lock` files. It is separate from the `flutter` extension so that a
lock it refuses breaks only the builds that use its repositories, never the
toolchains, and `bazel run @rules_flutter//flutter/pub`, which fixes the lock,
still runs.

The extension itself is defined in `flutter/pub/extensions.bzl`: a module
extension is identified by the file that defines it and its name.
