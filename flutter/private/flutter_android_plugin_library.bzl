"""Wrap a Flutter plugin's Android Kotlin/Java sources in a kt_android_library.

Public Tier-2 API: re-exported from `flutter/android.bzl`. For pub.dev
plugins, `flutter_pub_package` emits this automatically when
`android/src/main/{kotlin,java}/**/*.{kt,java}` sources are detected.

Wraps `kt_android_library` with the Flutter Android engine AAR as a dep
so the plugin's Kotlin/Java sees the FlutterPlugin SPI. A minimal
`AndroidManifest.xml` is generated when the plugin doesn't ship its
own manifest fragment, and a `BuildConfig` for its package, as Gradle
generates, with `DEBUG` and `BUILD_TYPE` of the build's mode.

    Args:
        name: Target name. Add it to `flutter_android_app(deps = ...)`,
            which packages it and registers its plugin class, or list it in
            the `exports` of the plugin's `flutter_plugin` (under a
            `select()` on `@platforms//os:android`), so that every app that
            depends on the plugin links it, as it does a pub.dev plugin's.
        srcs: Kotlin/Java source files (`.kt`, `.java`).
        java_package: Java package the plugin's classes live in
            (e.g. `io.flutter.plugins.urllauncher`). The namespace of its
            generated `BuildConfig`, and of a minimal manifest when none is
            provided. Defaults to
            `dev.flutter.plugins.<name>` to match the convention the
            registrant uses for fully-qualified class names.
        flutter_engine: A `flutter_android_engine` target declared with
            `neverlink = True`. Required for the plugin's Kotlin/Java to
            compile against the FlutterPlugin SPI; the app packages its own
            engine, of its own ABI.
        manifest: Optional AndroidManifest.xml fragment shipped with the
            plugin. Its components and permissions (`<receiver>`,
            `<service>`, `<uses-permission>`, ...) are merged into the app's
            manifest, as AGP merges a library's. Defaults to a minimal
            generated one that contributes nothing.
        deps: Extra Maven AAR / android_library deps. The Flutter
            Android engine is added automatically.
        visibility: Target visibility.
        tags: Bazel tags. Defaults to ["manual"].
