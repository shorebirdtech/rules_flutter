"""Compile a Flutter plugin's Apple sources into a swift_library.

This is the rules_flutter analog of the Podfile-driven CocoaPods build a
Flutter plugin author would otherwise rely on. It wraps `swift_library`
with the platform's Flutter framework as a dep. A plugin of Swift and C-family
sources both is one module of the two, rules_swift's
`mixed_language_library`, as SwiftPM and CocoaPods build it; a plugin of
C-family sources alone is an `objc_library`.

Public Tier-2 API: re-exported from `flutter/macos.bzl` and
`flutter/ios.bzl` so users can wire a monorepo plugin's BUILD.bazel
without going through the `ext/` overlay system.

Usage:

        name = "my_plugin_apple_macos",
        srcs = glob(["macos/Classes/**/*.swift"]),
        module_name = "my_plugin",

    With Swift and C, C++ or Objective-C sources (`.m`, `.mm`, `.c`, `.cpp`
    and the like) both, the library is one module of the two, as SwiftPM
    and CocoaPods build it: the Swift sees the module's public headers
    without an import, the C-family sources see the Swift through
    `<module_name>-Swift.h` (`#import <module_name/module_name-Swift.h>` or
    `#import "module_name-Swift.h"`), and importers see both. With C-family
    sources alone, the library is an `objc_library` whose Clang module is
    `module_name`, as SwiftPM, CocoaPods and Xcode build an Objective-C
    plugin; Swift sees it as a module through rules_swift's
    `swift_clang_module_aspect`. A Swift-only library may have
    a bridging header, `<module_name>-Bridging-Header.h` in `srcs`, which
    the Swift compile imports.

    Args:
        name: Target name. Pass to runner deps (or via the aspect-based
            aggregator that discovers them automatically).
        srcs: Swift, C, C++, Objective-C and header source files. When some
            headers are under an `include/` directory, as in SwiftPM's
            layout, and `public_hdrs` is not given, only those are the
            module's public headers; the others are private to the ObjC
            compile, as SwiftPM treats them.
        module_name: The module's name, which the plugin registrant imports.
            Defaults to `name`.
        platform: `"macos"` or `"ios"`, which picks the Flutter framework
            the sources compile against; or `"darwin"` for sources that build
            for both (`sharedDarwinSource`), which compile against the
            framework of the platform the build is for. List a `darwin`
            library as the `lib` of both the plugin's `ios` and `macos`
            `flutter_plugin_platform`.
        deps: Additional swift_library / cc_library deps: other plugins,
            other targets of the plugin's package. Both compiles see them.
        copts: Additional compile options, for both the Swift and the ObjC
            compile: a define a plugin's `Package.swift` sets is `-DNAME`,
            which Clang reads as `NAME=1` and Swift as a condition.
        clang_copts: Compile options for the C, C++ and Objective-C sources
            only: a `Package.swift`'s C and C++ defines and its C
            `unsafeFlags`. Split as a shell would, as `objc_library.copts`.
        cxxopts: Compile options for the C++ and Objective-C++ sources only:
            the package's C++ language standard, its C++ `unsafeFlags`. Only
            for a library without Swift sources, as a Swift package target
            is; a library of both takes `clang_copts`.
        conlyopts: Compile options for the C sources only: the package's C
            language standard. Only for a library without Swift sources.
        swift_copts: Compile options for the Swift sources only: a
            `Package.swift`'s Swift defines (`-DNAME`) and its Swift
            `unsafeFlags`.
        linkopts: Options for the link of any binary that links the plugin:
            a `Package.swift`'s linker `unsafeFlags`.
        public_hdrs: The headers of the plugin's module, which the
            `publicHeadersPath` of a `Package.swift` target holds; the other
            headers in `srcs` are private to its compile. Without it, see
            `srcs`.
        textual_hdrs: Headers the C-family sources may include that are
            not the library's own: those of the other targets of a Swift
            package, which SwiftPM lets any target include by path.
        includes: Header search paths forwarded to the inner
            `objc_library`. Mirrors `objc_library.includes` semantics —
            each entry becomes `-I <package>/<entry>` for both the
            ObjC compile and downstream consumers, matching SwiftPM's
            `publicHeadersPath` behavior. Required for plugins that
            follow SwiftPM's canonical layout (header at
            `Sources/<pkg>/include/<pkg>/Foo.h`, `.m` does bare-basename
            `#import "Foo.h"`); without the include path the .m's import
            fails with `'Foo.h' file not found`.
        sdk_frameworks: Apple SDK frameworks to link (e.g. `["AVFoundation"]`),
            as a `Package.swift`'s `linkedFramework` does. A framework the
            C-family sources import is linked without this, as Xcode links
            it: the library compiles them with Clang's module autolinking on.
            A plugin built from its `Package.swift` gets its `linkerSettings`
            without this; an overlay lists them here.
        sdk_dylibs: Apple SDK dynamic libraries to link (e.g. `["c++"]`,
            `["sqlite3"]`), as a `Package.swift`'s `linkedLibrary` does.
        data: Resources the app carries for the library, such as the
            `apple_resource_bundle` of a Swift package target's resources.
        swift_language_mode: `"6"` to compile the Swift sources in Swift 6
            mode, as SwiftPM compiles a target of a `swift-tools-version:
            6.0` package; Swift 5 (the default) otherwise.
        visibility: Target visibility.
        tags: Bazel tags. Defaults to `["manual"]` so the spoke target
            is only built when something depends on it.
        **kwargs: Forwarded to the underlying `swift_library`,
            `mixed_language_library` or `objc_library`.
