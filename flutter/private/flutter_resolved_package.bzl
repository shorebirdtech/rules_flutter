"""Spoke for a package `flutter_pub.from_lock(resolve = ...)` maps to a workspace target.

The package's files are in the user's repository, built there by a
`flutter_library`, `flutter_plugin` or `dart_library`. This repository holds one
target, `<package>`, a `resolved_package` over that target (see
`resolved_package.bzl`), so `@<hub>//:<package>` and a hosted package that
depends on the package both reach the one target. It is a forwarding target and
not a copy of the files: a copy would build the package a second time under a
second label, and an edit to the package would not reach the copy until the
repository was fetched again. The locked package, when the lock has it from a
registry or git, is never fetched.

The extension checks the map against the lock when it reads it, and
`resolved_package` checks at analysis that the target declares the package's
name. Neither the target's location nor the lock's version is checked: the map
says where Bazel gets the package.
