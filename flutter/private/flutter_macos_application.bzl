"""Flutter macOS App.framework assembly and native lib staging.

Two rules:

1. `flutter_macos_app_framework` — assembles the AOT dylib (release) or kernel
   .dill (debug) into an App.framework with macOS directory structure.
   The framework is placed into the .app via additional_contents (NOT linked

2. `flutter_macos_native_libs` — stages native .dylib files, flat under their

These are exported as `flutter_macos_app_framework_gen` and `flutter_macos_native_libs_gen`
from flutter/macos.bzl.

    Includes both the legacy `native_libs` set (from `native_deps`-style
    FFI cc_library targets), which always ships, and the code assets
    (`dart_code_asset(link_mode = "dynamic_loading_bundle")` libraries) that
    ship: in a release build a package's link hook chooses among its code
    assets, so the staging action reads which from the program's assets
    file. rules_apple's `additional_contents = {target: "Frameworks"}`
    machinery code-signs the dylibs as part of the outer `macos_application`
    build — no bespoke codesign action needed here.

    Every library ships as `Contents/Frameworks/<basename>`, because that is
    where the loader finds it: a bare-name `DynamicLibrary.open` resolves
    there, and so does a Native Assets manifest entry. Handing rules_apple the
    files themselves does not achieve that. It places a plain file at its path
    relative to its owning package, so a library that is not at its package
    root (a vendored `third_party/foo/lib/libfoo.dylib`, a genrule writing into
    a subdirectory) lands in `Frameworks/lib/`, which codesign rejects as a
    malformed bundle and dyld never searches.

    So the libraries are copied into one directory under their basenames, and
    that directory is what this target provides: rules_apple expands a tree
    artifact's contents into the destination, as it does for App.framework's
    wrapper. The directory is named after this target, which keeps two apps in
    one package from declaring the same output. No two libraries can share a
    basename there: `flutter_application` checks every candidate.
