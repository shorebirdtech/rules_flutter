"""The web SDK slice of an engine checkout's out dirs.

`flutter_engine_out_dirs` (local_sdk.bzl) reads the checkout; this module
links the web SDK of its `wasm_release` out dir (`flutter_web_sdk/`, the
`--web` build of `tools/gn`, where flutter_tools'
`CachedLocalWebSdkArtifacts` reads it) and writes the `web` package
(the labels of `engine_labels.bzl`):

* `web:sdk`: the `flutter_web_sdk` slice, with the platform kernels the web
  compilers read and whether the out dir holds the renderers (`canvaskit/`).
* the files a web application names (`engine_labels.WEB_SLICE_FILES`), as
  aliases into the linked tree.

The web SDK's `libraries.json` includes `../dart-sdk/lib/libraries.json`, so the
Dart SDK of the host tools is linked beside it, as the release's web SDK
repository does. The compilers that read the platform kernels are that Dart
SDK's, which is why the pieces are checked against it (`sdk_check.dart`).
