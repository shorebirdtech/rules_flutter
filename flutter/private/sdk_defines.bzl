"""The defines `flutter_tools` adds to every program it compiles.

`flutter build`, `flutter run` and `flutter test` describe the SDK and the app
to the program through its Dart environment: `FlutterVersion` and
`appBuildName` (`package:flutter/services.dart`) read them as
`String.fromEnvironment`. Left out, they read null.

The SDK's are the same for every program built with one SDK, and
`flutter_tools` takes them from the installed SDK (`FlutterVersion`); here they
come from the release the toolchain pins (`versions.bzl`). The app's are its
`build_name` and `build_number`, which `flutter_tools` takes from
`--build-name` and `--build-number` or the `version:` of `pubspec.yaml`.
