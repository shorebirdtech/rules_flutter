"""Apple plugins whose `Package.swift` decides its defines from the app.

Some plugins' manifests compute their C or Swift defines from what surrounds
the build: `permission_handler_apple` reads the app's Info.plist and compiles
in each permission whose usage description the plist has; `audio_session` and
`geolocator_apple` read an environment variable. Under `flutter build`, Xcode
evaluates the manifest with its working directory in the app and the user's
shell environment, once per app.

rules_flutter does the same per app, in the build. `flutter_pub_package` marks
such a plugin (`find_manifest_computations` and `find_swiftpm_build_settings`
both find something in its manifest), and its Apple repository builds it in
three parts:

* The plugin's library, as the fetch-time `dump-package` describes it, but
  with its defines taken from `flutter_swiftpm_app_settings`, one per target of
  the package. That rule evaluates the manifest with Xcode's `swift package`,
  in an action, for the app the build settings below name: with `PWD` in a
  stand-in of the app's folder holding the app's Info.plist, and with the
  environment the app gives. Its defines become a header, which every C-family
  compile of the target includes, and a response file, which its Swift compile
  reads. Anything else the evaluation finds different from the fetch-time one
  fails the build: only defines may depend on the app.
* `flutter_swiftpm_app_library`, named as the plugin's library is
  (`<package>_apple_<platform>`), which the plugin's `apple_libs` names. It is
  a marker that names the library, and builds nothing.
* An entry in `@flutter_pub_apple_app_settings//:libraries`, the build's list
  of such libraries (`flutter_apple_app_settings_repo`).

An Apple app's `flutter_apple_plugins_aggregator` depends on that list through
`swiftpm_app_transition`, which sets the two build settings to the app's
Info.plist and its `swift_package_environment`, and links the library of each
marker in the app's graph from there. Apps with the same Info.plist target and
environment share one build of each such plugin; another app gets its own.
