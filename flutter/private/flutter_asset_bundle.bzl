    Args:

        dart: The `dart` executable File from the Flutter SDK.
        dart_files: The files `dart` needs to run `generate_asset_manifest.dart`
            from source, and to start `const_finder`'s snapshot: the `run` set
            of the SDK (`DartSdkFilesInfo.run`).

        notices: License text string to compress into NOTICES.Z.
        license_files: list of File objects containing license text to include in NOTICES.Z.
        output_dir: The already-declared directory (tree artifact) File to
            write the bundle into. Declared by the caller rather than here
            because an application has to know where its assets will land
            *before* this action runs — the path is baked into the app as
            `rules_flutter.build_info.assetsDir`, which the dev tool matches
            against the tree it watches and rebuilds. Declaring an output and
            registering the action that fills it are separate steps in
            Starlark, so hoisting the declaration introduces no cycle even
            though icon tree shaking makes this action depend on the kernel.
        const_finder: File for const_finder.dart.snapshot (enables icon tree shaking).
        font_subset: File for font-subset binary (enables icon tree shaking).
        kernel_dill: File for the compiled kernel .dill (needed for icon tree shaking).
        optional_code_points: Code points every subset icon font keeps if the
            font has a glyph for them, used or not (`optional:<n>` to
            font-subset).
        extra_asset_copies: list of (key, File) for assets that need a specific
            key (e.g. "fonts/MaterialIcons-Regular.otf"). They are listed in the
            asset manifest.
        unlisted_asset_copies: the same, for files that are bundled without
            being an entry of the asset manifest.
