    registrant library the engine invokes before main() on every
    root-isolate launch — including hot restart.

    If aot and platform_dill are not specified, they follow the build mode
    (`flutter_build_mode`): debug → debug dill + JIT, profile → debug
    (non-product) dill + AOT, release → product dill + AOT.

    Args:
        ctx: Rule context (must have main, srcs, deps, defines attrs).

            through when set; the manifest's contents may be empty.
        track_widget_creation: Whether to pass `--track-widget-creation` to
            the frontend server, and to tell the dev tool the kernel has it
            (the `trackWidgetCreation` of the debug `rules_flutter.build_info`
            record). Passed rather than read off `ctx.attr`,

            `flutter_kernel_target` has no such attr — and a rule that has no
            opinion should say `False` rather than be probed for one.
        assets_dir: The declared `flutter_assets/` tree artifact, from
            `declare_flutter_assets_dir`. Supplying it is what makes a debug
            build carry `rules_flutter.build_info`; the rules with no asset

            `flutter_aot_target`) leave it None and emit no define, because
            an app with no assets tree has nothing for the dev tool to watch.
        platform_build_args: Flags from `launch_build_args`, recorded in
            `build_info` so an attaching dev tool can reproduce this
            configuration. Only meaningful alongside `assets_dir`.
        recorded_uses: Optional declared File for the compiler's recorded
            `@RecordUse` uses, the input of package link hooks. Pass it for
            AOT compiles only.
        inputs: The program to compile, from `flutter_program_inputs`; `ctx`'s
            own when None. A program rebuilt under another target
            (`flutter_application_variant`) is the application's, changed, and
