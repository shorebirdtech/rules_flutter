"""Flutter's kernel platform: the SDK description, and the aspect that compiles modules against it.

rules_dart compiles each library target once into a kernel module, and an
executable compiles only its entrypoint against those modules and links them
(see rules_dart's `dart_module.bzl`); a whole program is compiled from source
in one action (`dart_whole_program_kernel_action`). A kernel is valid only for
the platform it was compiled against, so Flutter describes its own here, from
the selected SDK, and has its own aspect and modules.

    """The `DartKernelSdkInfo` of one Flutter SDK's platform.

    A runtime per build mode, as flutter_tools compiles for each
    (`buildModeOptions` in `compile.dart`): debug and profile against the
    non-product platform, which keeps the VM service and the profiling hooks,
    and release against the product one. Each fixes `dart.vm.profile` and
    `dart.vm.product`, constants the front end folds, so a kernel for one mode
    cannot run as another's. Profile and release also drop the `toString`
    bodies of `dart:ui` and `package:flutter` classes, as `flutter build` does,
    for a smaller snapshot.

    Args:
      sdk: A `FlutterSdkInfo` or `FlutterExecToolsInfo` of the selected SDK,
        for the host the compile runs on.
      libraries_spec: The `libraries.json` naming the `dart:` libraries a
        Flutter program can import, which modules compile against; None for
        a whole-program compile, which reads the platform dill instead.
      extra_defines: Declarations every compile against this SDK carries, for
        modules (a module's constants are folded when it is compiled, so what
        describes the SDK to the program cannot wait for the link). A
        whole-program compile adds the SDK's to its own environment instead.

    Returns:
      The `DartKernelSdkInfo`. It has a `release` runtime only where `sdk`
      has the product platform, which a debug build does not fetch.
