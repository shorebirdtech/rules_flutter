"""Assembling a directory artifact from trees and files, on any host.

A tree artifact cannot be built up by Starlark alone: copying a directory's
contents, or adding files beside them, takes an action that runs something.
That something is `tools/assemble_directory.dart`, run by the exec-tools
toolchain's `dart`, so the action runs wherever that toolchain does and needs
no POSIX shell (`cp -R`) or Windows one.

A rule that calls `assemble_directory` merges `ASSEMBLE_DIRECTORY_ATTRS` into
its `attrs` and runs the action in the `PORTABLE` exec group.
