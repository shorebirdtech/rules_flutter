`showLicensePage` and `LicenseRegistry` read one asset, `NOTICES.Z` (gzip) or,
on the web, `NOTICES`. It is made by its own action rather than by the asset
bundle's: its inputs are licence files alone, so an edit to an asset or a new
kernel does not rerun it, and programs with the same packages share its output
through the cache. Merging and compressing the engine's 1.3 MB of licences is
the costly part of bundling.
