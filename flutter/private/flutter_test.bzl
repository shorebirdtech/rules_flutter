"""Flutter test rules: `flutter_suite_program` compiles, `flutter_test` declares a test.

`flutter_suite_program` compiles a Flutter test entry point to a kernel `.dill`
(`FlutterTestProgramInfo`), and `flutter_program_test`
(`flutter_program_test.bzl`) runs a program under `flutter_tester`, the
headless Flutter engine. `flutter_test` is the macro that declares both. Tests interact with the test
runner via the same `package:test_api/backend.dart` `RemoteListener`
protocol that `flutter test` uses, so widget tests that initialize
`TestWidgetsFlutterBinding` (every `testWidgets`, every golden, the live
binding) work.

Wire-up:
  1. Bazel writes a per-target bootstrap `<name>_bootstrap.dart` that imports
     the user's test as `test`, then calls `RemoteListener.start(() => test.main)`
     and pipes the resulting StreamChannel over a WebSocket to the runner. When
     the suite carries `package:flutter_test`, the same callback installs the
     golden-file comparator, exactly where `flutter test` installs its own —
     see `flutter/private/goldens/comparator.dart`.
  2. Each library in `deps` is compiled once per configuration into a kernel
     module (`flutter_module_aspect`, rules_dart's per-library compile over the
     debug Flutter platform), with the test's `defines`. The test's own files
     are compiled against those modules, the bootstrap compiled as the entry
     point, and all of it listed in a kernel list, which the runner joins into the
     one kernel flutter_tester loads when it starts it (in memory on Linux, a
     temporary file elsewhere), so no test stores a copy of its libraries.
     With `--@rules_dart//dart:kernel_list=false` the build joins them into
     one `.dill` instead. A test therefore recompiles only its own files, and a change to a shared
     library recompiles that library's module and those downstream of it once,
     not every test that reaches it. With
     `--@rules_dart//dart:modular_kernel=false` the test instead compiles its
     whole program from source, as `flutter_application` does.
  3. The runner binary spawns `flutter_tester` with the dill, hosts a localhost
     WebSocket harness, drives the `package:test` MultiChannel protocol, and
     reports per-test pass/fail.

Coverage: when `bazel coverage` sets `COVERAGE_OUTPUT_FILE`, the runner
launches `flutter_tester` with the VM service enabled and collects source
reports via JSON-RPC, writing LCOV for the test's own package and sources.

Usage:
    flutter_test(
        name = "widget_test",
        main = "test/widget_test.dart",
        deps = [
            "@deps//:flutter",
            "@deps//:flutter_test",
            "//:my_app_lib",
        ],
    )

The user's `deps` must transitively expose `package:flutter_test` (and
therefore `package:test_api`) so the generated bootstrap compiles.

Golden files: `matchesGoldenFile('goldens/x.png')` reads
`<dir of the test's main>/goldens/x.png` out of runfiles, so every golden has
to be a declared input — list them in `data`. Regenerate with
`bazel run //<pkg>:<target> -- --update-goldens`, which writes back to the
source tree; the same flag under `bazel test` is refused, because a test action
cannot write there.

    The bootstrap is the kernel entry point flutter_tester loads. It calls
    `RemoteListener.start(() => test.main)` to register the user's tests with

    `FLUTTER_TEST_HARNESS_PORT` and forwards the resulting channel as
    JSON-encoded `[id, data]` tuples (the `package:stream_channel`
    MultiChannel framing the test harness already speaks).

    The golden block is emitted at the same point `flutter test` emits its own
    — inside the `RemoteListener.start` callback, before the user's `main` is
    returned — and, like upstream's, only when the suite actually depends on
    `package:flutter_test`. Upstream guards it with `if (flutterTestDep)` for
    the same reason this takes an import that may be None: a suite carrying
    only `package:test_api` has no `goldenFileComparator` to assign to, and an
    unconditional import would fail its kernel compile over a feature it
    cannot use.

under flutter_tester, the headless Flutter engine, as an ordinary executable: \
with `bazel run`, or as the tool of a build action, so outputs made with it \
need not be `testonly`.

The program is written as a test suite, because flutter_tester draws frames \
through `package:flutter_test`'s binding: its work is the bodies of its \
`testWidgets` and `test` calls. It exits 0 when every one passes and non-zero \
when one fails, as `flutter_test` reports a suite. Arguments are not passed to \
the program; the environment is, and the program runs in the working directory \
it was started in, Native Assets included, so a build action can hand it paths \
under the exec root. `enable_impeller` renders with Impeller, which needs the \
host's GPU: an action running one should not be sent to a remote executor.

Build it for the host it runs on: `bazel run` does, and a rule that runs it in \
an action takes it as an executable attribute with `cfg = "exec"`, as a \
`genrule` takes its `tools`.""",
