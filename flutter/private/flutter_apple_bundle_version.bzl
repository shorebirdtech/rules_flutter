`flutter_ios_app` and `flutter_macos_app` declare one from their `build_name`
and `build_number`. Declare one yourself to give an app extension the same
version as its app, passing it as the `version` of both, and give it the app's
`application`, whose version it takes:

    flutter_apple_bundle_version(
        name = "version",
        application = ":app_flutter",

The app checks that its `version` is its `application`'s, so one with another
version, or with none and so the defaults, fails the app's build.

It provides what rules_apple's `apple_bundle_version` provides, so either fits
any `version` attribute.""",
