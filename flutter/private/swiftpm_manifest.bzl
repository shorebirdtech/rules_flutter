"""What rules_flutter reads from a pub plugin's `Package.swift`.

rules_flutter compiles a plugin's own sources, not a SwiftPM build, and builds
them as the manifest says: `swift package dump-package` evaluates the manifest
(the plugin's Apple repository runs it, see `apple_plugin_repo.bzl`), and
`swift_package_targets` turns the plugin's targets into the attributes of its
`flutter_apple_plugin_library`: its sources, its header search paths, and its
C, C++, Swift and linker settings, each under the platform and configuration
its condition names.

Dependencies. A pub plugin whose Apple side is a SwiftPM package lists what it
needs from other packages in `dependencies:`:

    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-log", from: "1.0.0"),
        .package(path: "../shared"),
    ],

A remote package's products are the targets of its repository, which the app's
`Package.resolved` pins (`swift_packages.bzl`). The Flutter framework's package
and a sibling plugin's are supplied by the build. A dependency on a directory
inside the plugin is fine: its sources are part of the plugin. Another
directory outside the plugin is not, and `find_unsupported_swiftpm_dependencies`
reports it.

Settings a manifest computes. `.define` and `.unsafeFlags` in a target's
`cSettings`, `cxxSettings` or `swiftSettings` set preprocessor macros and
compiler flags, and a manifest that imports more than `PackageDescription`, or
reads its `Context`, can compute them from what surrounds the build:
`permission_handler_apple` reads the app's `Info.plist` and enables a
permission's code only when the plist declares its usage description, so
built without its defines every permission reports `denied`, and nothing
fails. Evaluated in the plugin's repository, such a manifest computes them for
no app at all. `find_manifest_computations` says whether a manifest can, and
`find_swiftpm_build_settings` whether it sets any: a manifest that does both is
evaluated again for each app, which its defines are taken from
(`swiftpm_app_settings.bzl`).

    """What a plugin's `Package.swift` says its `platform` library is built from.

    Flutter links a plugin's Swift package through its library product named
    after the plugin, with `-` for `_` (`flutter-qjs-next`), and imports the
    module named after the plugin. rules_flutter builds the product's targets
    and the package's targets they depend on, each a module of its own. The
    product's target named after the plugin (or its only target) is the
    plugin's module, and depends on the product's other targets, which the
    product links with it.

    Args:
        dump: The manifest as `swift package dump-package` prints it, decoded.
        package_name: The plugin's package name.
        platform: `"ios"` or `"macos"`.
        manifest_dir: The directory holding the manifest, relative to the
            plugin's root (`ios/foo`); the paths returned are relative to the
            plugin's root too.
        defines: Whether the settings hold the manifest's defines. False
            for a manifest that decides them from the app, whose defines
            come from its evaluation for each app (`swiftpm_app_settings.bzl`).

    Returns:
        A struct with `problems`, what keeps rules_flutter from building the
        package as the manifest says (a list of strings, empty when there is
        nothing), and, when there are none: `main`, the name of the target
        that is the plugin's module; `dynamic`, whether the product is
        `.dynamic`; and `targets`, the targets to build,
        each after those it depends on. A target is a struct: `name`;
        `deps`, the names of the package's targets it depends on;
        `swift_language_mode`, `"5"` or `"6"`; `resources`, structs with
        `path` and `copy` (`.copy`, else `.process`); `resource_bundle`, the
        name of the bundle SwiftPM puts them in (`<package>_<target>`);
        `remote_products`, the `(identity, product)` of each product of a
        remote package (`.package(url:)`) it depends on; `dir`, its
        source directory; `sources`, the files and directories its sources
        are in (its whole directory when the manifest names none);
        `exclude`; `public_headers`, its public header directory;
        `includes`; and its settings, each a dict from configuration (a
        `CONFIGURATIONS` entry) to a list: `clang_copts` (C, Objective-C and
        C++ compiles), `cxxopts` (C++ compiles), `conlyopts` (C compiles),
        `swift_copts`, `linkopts`, `sdk_frameworks` and `sdk_dylibs`. A copt
