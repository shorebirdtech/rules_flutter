"""Native code a pub plugin's own build makes and rules_flutter does not.

`flutter build` builds a plugin for each platform with that platform's build
system: Gradle for Android, CocoaPods for iOS and macOS, CMake for Linux and
Windows. rules_flutter runs none of them. It compiles the plugin's Kotlin,
Java, Swift, Objective-C and C++ sources and reads what it can of the build
files (Maven dependencies, link libraries), but a library the build makes by
some other means is not made at all:

* Gradle's `externalNativeBuild` (CMake or ndk-build), as in package:jni.
* cargokit, which flutter_rust_bridge plugins use to build a Rust crate with
  cargo: an `apply from: ".../cargokit/gradle/plugin.gradle"` in the Gradle
  script, a podspec script phase running `cargokit/build_pod.sh`, and
  `apply_cargokit()` in a CMakeLists.txt.
* Any other CocoaPods script phase, which runs a shell step in the build.
* A CMakeLists.txt that sets `<plugin>_bundled_libraries`, Flutter's way of
  shipping a library the plugin's CMake build makes or downloads.
* `ffiPlugin: true` for the platform in the pubspec: Flutter builds the
  plugin's native sources into a library that Dart opens by name.

Each yields an app missing the library, which builds and fails at run time
when the plugin loads it. The functions here say which mechanism a build file
uses; `flutter_pub_package` records it per platform, and the platform's build
fails naming it: Android when it loads the plugin's `android/` package, iOS and
macOS in `flutter_apple_plugins_aggregator`, Linux and Windows in the runner
(`plugin_link_flags`). Other platforms are unaffected. A package an overlay
builds is not checked: the overlay is how the library is supplied.
