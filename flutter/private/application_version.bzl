"""A bundle and its program describe one version.

`flutter build --build-name 2.1.0` gives the bundle's version fields and the
program's `appBuildName` the same value. Here the program is a
`flutter_application`, compiled once, and a platform app is built over it: each
has a `build_name` and a `build_number`. A bundle that said 2.1.0 while its code
reported 1.0.0 would ship a version nobody chose, so the application states the
version and the platform app takes it. An app may state it too, and then the
application must state the same: an application that says nothing reports the
defaults, and a bundle that says otherwise disagrees with it.

Every other place a bundle's version can be written is held to the same rule:
an iOS or macOS app's `version` target, an Android app's `manifest_values`
`versionCode` and `versionName`, the version attributes of the app's own
`AndroidManifest.xml` or keys of its `Info.plist`, and the `version` and
`build_number` of a web app's own `version.json`. Each may say what the
application says, and the build fails, naming both, where it says otherwise.

`--@rules_flutter//flutter:build_name` and `--@rules_flutter//flutter:build_number`
set the version for one build, as `flutter build --build-name` and
`--build-number` do: each replaces every application's attribute. An app's
`build_name` or `build_number` argument, which may only repeat its
application's, follows the setting with it, as `flutter create`'s
`$(FLUTTER_BUILD_NUMBER)` and `flutter.versionCode` follow the flag. A value an
app writes as it is (a `versionCode` in `manifest_values`, a version file or
target that states its own numbers, a literal in a plist, manifest or
version.json) cannot follow, so it must be the version the setting gives, or
the build fails naming both.
