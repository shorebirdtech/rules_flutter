"""What the bundle-parts aspects share: walking a launch target's dependencies.

A hot restart reads two things of the app it restarts: the `flutter_assets`
tree and the native libraries the launch artifact carries. Each platform has an
aspect that collects them below the launch target, in the configuration each
was built in, so that building its output groups builds them and nothing of the
artifact itself. These are the parts of that walk no platform changes.
