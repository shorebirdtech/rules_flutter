"""AndroidManifest.xml permission merging.

Three callers, one mechanism. `flutter create` declares
`android.permission.INTERNET` only in the debug (and profile) variant
manifests under `android/app/src/debug/`; Gradle's manifest merger folds
them into debug APKs, and `flutter_android_app` reproduces that fold here.
The same rule also backs `flutter_android_app(permissions = [...])`, which
folds the app's *own* permissions in for every compilation mode — the seam a
networked app needs, since the debug variant's INTERNET belongs to the Dart
VM service and never reaches release.

It also lifts the `<uses-permission>` elements of the app's Android
libraries (plugins and AARs) into the app's manifest, as Gradle's merger
does. Bazel's merger drops a library's permissions unless
`--merge_android_manifest_permissions` is set, and an app built without that
flag shipped without them: a plugin's POST_NOTIFICATIONS, say, so Android 13
could never ask to show its notifications.

Given a `namespace`, the same action writes the manifest's relative component
class names (`.MainActivity`, `.sub.Receiver`, a bare `MainActivity`) in full
against it, as AGP's manifest merger does, so they do not resolve against the
application id instead: one `flutter create` runner can then ship under any
application id.

Given `set_version`, it writes the app's version onto the root
`<manifest>` as `android:versionCode` and `android:versionName`, from
`build_number` and `build_name` or the application's, the attributes Gradle
writes from `flutter.versionCode` and `flutter.versionName`. Done here rather
than through `android_binary`'s `manifest_values` so that the values may be a
`select()`. A base that declares either attribute must declare that value.

Given `uncompressed_native_libs`, it marks `<application>` with
`android:extractNativeLibs="false"`, as AGP does for an app whose native
libraries it stores uncompressed (`jniLibs.useLegacyPackaging = false`, its
default from a minimum SDK of 23).

Each runs the rules_flutter merger tool
(`merge_android_manifests.dart`) over a base manifest and an overlay.

The merger accepts only `<uses-permission>` / `<uses-permission-sdk-23>`
elements in the overlay and hard-fails on anything else, so it can never
silently mis-merge a variant manifest it does not fully understand.
