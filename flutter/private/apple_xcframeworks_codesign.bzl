"""Signing the add-to-app xcframeworks, as a layer over their unsigned build.

`flutter build ios-framework` and `macos-framework` sign every xcframework
they make with the developer's identity (and leave Flutter's own engine
xcframework with Flutter's signature). Here the xcframeworks are built
unsigned, as rules_apple's `apple_xcframework` builds them, so the build is
the same on every machine and is cached; `flutter_apple_xcframeworks_codesign`
wraps that build and signs it in an action of its own, as rules_apple signs a
bundle: on this machine (`no-remote`), outside the sandbox (`no-sandbox`) so
`codesign` reaches the keychain, and only after the identity is found in it.
A change of identity re-runs only the signing.
