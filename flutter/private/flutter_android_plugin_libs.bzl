"""The Android libraries of the plugins an application depends on.

`flutter_android_plugin_libs(application = ...)` is what `flutter_android_app`
puts on its `android_binary` and its plugin registrant, in place of a library
for every package of the lock. An application's plugins are known only after
analysis has read its dependency graph (`FlutterApplicationInfo.android_libs`),
and a BUILD file cannot name them, so this rule links them: it returns what a
`kt_android_library` listing those libraries in `exports` would, so that
`android_binary` and the registrant compile and package them as ordinary
dependencies.

It also checks the Maven artifacts the linked plugins' Gradle builds declare
against what `@rules_flutter_maven` resolved, for those plugins only: an app
that does not link a plugin never needs its artifacts. And it checks that a
device of the ABI can load the native libraries the plugins bring, prebuilt
ones inside their AARs included: on a 64-bit ABI, that they are aligned for
16 KB pages.
