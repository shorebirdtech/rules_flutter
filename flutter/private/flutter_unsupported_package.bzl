"""Spoke for a lock entry rules_flutter has no repository for.

A `pubspec.lock` lists packages from sources rules_flutter cannot provide:
sources it has never heard of, and `path` packages the user declared with
`flutter_pub.from_lock(ignored = ...)`, which no Bazel build may contain. (Hosted, git and `sdk: flutter` packages it
builds, and `path` packages are the user's own targets; see
`lock_entry_kind.bzl`.) A hub that failed to load over such an entry would break
every app that merely lists it, even though nothing in Bazel uses it.

The hub therefore still lists the package. Its target is a stub that fails when
Bazel analyses something that depends on it, with a message naming the package,
where the lock got it from, and what to do. Nothing that does not depend on it is
affected.
