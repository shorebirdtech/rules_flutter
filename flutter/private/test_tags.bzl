    Each entry is one `package:test` selector, as one `--tags` value is. An
    empty entry selects nothing, a comma is how `--tags` separates selectors
    (and rules_dart's `dart_test`, which passes each entry as its own `--tags`,
    refuses one), and the runner joins entries with newlines: each is a mistake
    in the BUILD file. Whether an entry is a selector `package:test` can parse
    is only known to the runner, which says so when the test runs.

    Args:
        ctx: The rule context.
        attr_name: `include_tags` or `exclude_tags`.
