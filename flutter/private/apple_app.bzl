"""The target a user names for a Flutter iOS or macOS app.

`ios_application` and `macos_application` change the platform of their own
configuration (to iOS, to macOS), and a target is checked against
`target_compatible_with` in the configuration it is built in. So the
constraints a user puts on the app, or the macro puts on it for the platforms
it is for, are never seen as they were written on the rules_apple target: an
iOS platform has no `@platforms//os:macos` to satisfy, and on a Linux build
the rule is analysed (and fails) before anything compares the platforms.

A target in front of the rules_apple one does not change the platform. It
carries the constraints, so `bazel build //...` on a platform the app is not
for reports it SKIPPED, and forwards what the rules_apple target provides.
