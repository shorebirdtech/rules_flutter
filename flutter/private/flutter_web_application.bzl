"""Flutter web application build.

Produces a deployable web directory containing:
- main.dart.wasm + main.dart.mjs (compiler="dart2wasm"), plus main.dart.js
  unless `js_fallback = False` leaves the JavaScript build out
  or main.dart.js alone (compiler="dart2js")
- flutter.js (Flutter engine bootstrapper from web SDK)
- canvaskit/ (renderer engine artifacts; only with use_local_canvaskit, or in a
  debug build for the dev loop)
- flutter_assets/ (AssetManifest.bin.json for web)
- index.html
- flutter_bootstrap.js
- flutter_service_worker.js (optional; tears down a previously installed
  caching service worker — see flutter/private/web_service_worker.bzl)

When compiler="dart2wasm", both WASM and JS outputs are produced by default,
as `flutter build web --wasm` does. The bootstrap lists both builds so the
Flutter engine tries WASM first and falls back to JS (CanvasKit) on browsers
that cannot run the WASM build. `js_fallback = False` makes the output
WebAssembly only: no dart2js action runs, the bootstrap lists the WASM build
alone, and nothing the rule generates refers to main.dart.js. A browser that
cannot run it then gets no app (flutter.js logs that no compatible build was
found and throws; the generated bootstrap shows a message instead).

Both dart2wasm and dart2js take .dart source directly (not kernel .dill),
so we skip the frontend_server kernel compilation step used by desktop/mobile.

The program is the bundle's `flutter_application`'s, built once for each
compiler the bundle ships, so a dependency may differ between dart2wasm and
dart2js (see `flutter_web_branch.bzl`). The macro in `web.bzl` declares the
staging target each compiler's inputs come from, over the application.
