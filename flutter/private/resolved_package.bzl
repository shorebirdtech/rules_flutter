"""The target a `flutter_pub.from_lock(resolve = ...)` package's label is.

The hub's label for a mapped package reaches the user's target through this
rule instead of an `alias`, so that it can check what an alias cannot: the
target builds the package it stands for. The Dart package names the target
declares (`DartInfo.packages`) must include the key it is mapped under, or an
import of `package:<key>/...` would resolve to nothing, or to another package,
in a build that otherwise succeeds. Everything else a Flutter package target
carries is handed on as it is.

The target is held in `deps`, the attribute rules_dart's aspects and
rules_android's dex aspect follow, so they reach the real target through this
one.
