"""The library repository of a built package of `flutter_pub.from_lock()`.

A package's files are in its source repository (`flutter_pub_package`); this
one decides what it is built with. It reads the pubspec dependencies of every
package the package reaches, as their source repositories record them (which
fetches only what building the package fetches anyway), and finds its
dependency cycle with rules_dart's planning (`pub_graph.bzl`). Pub allows
packages to depend on each other (`dio` and `dio_web_adapter` do), and Bazel
does not, so a cycle is one library, in the library repository of its first
package by name, which every other package of the cycle aliases.

The library is a `flutter_pub_library` over the members of the cycle, or
rules_dart's `pub_library` when none of them has anything of Flutter's.
Either way its dependencies are the libraries of whatever the cycle depends on
outside itself.
