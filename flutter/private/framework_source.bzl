"""A Flutter framework source, as the repositories built from it read it.

A framework source is a repository whose root is a flutter/flutter tree
(docs/design/design_custom_engine.md, section 6): `packages/<name>/` for every
`sdk: flutter` package, `packages/flutter_tools/`, the `sky_engine` package,
`bin/internal/material_fonts.version`, and `flutter_framework.json`, which says
what the tree is:

    {"version": "<flutterVersion>", "commit": "<sha or empty>",
     "dirty": false, "origin": "<release|local|archive|...>"}

The repositories that read one take the label of its `flutter_framework.json`
as an attribute, so Bazel fetches the source before they run.
