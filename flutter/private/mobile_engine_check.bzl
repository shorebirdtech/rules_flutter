"""Whether the engine of the selected SDK holds what a mobile app is built for.

A custom engine is built for one CPU, and an iOS one for one environment (the
device or the simulator). The release's engines hold every one an app can be
built for, so these checks pass for it; for a local engine they fail at
analysis, naming the engine and what it holds, rather than at link time or at
launch.
