"""The one place a repository rule's download digest is checked.

An empty `sha256` is not an error to Bazel; it means "do not check". A digest it
cannot parse is only found after the whole archive has been fetched. Every
download in rules_flutter's repository rules therefore passes its digest
through `pinned`, which refuses a missing or malformed one before any request
is made, naming the artifact:

    repository_ctx.download_and_extract(
        url = ...,
        sha256 = pinned("sky_engine.zip", repository_ctx.attr.sha256),
    )

`//tools/download_guard` reads the sources and fails on a download whose digest
can still be empty.
