"""Flutter iOS application bundling (private implementation).

Produces the intermediate artifacts needed for an iOS .ipa:
- Release (AOT): App.framework/App (Mach-O dylib) + Info.plist + flutter_assets/
- Debug (JIT): App.framework/App (stub dylib) + Info.plist + flutter_assets/ (with kernel_blob.bin)

The framework is packaged by flutter_ios_app_framework_gen (a macro in flutter/ios.bzl)
which wraps it with apple_dynamic_framework_import for seamless integration
with rules_apple's ios_application. Debug mode uses bundle_only=True to
embed the framework without linking (stub binary is not loaded at runtime).
