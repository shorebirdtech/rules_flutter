"""Which directories hold the resolution variants of an asset.

Shared by the pub package repository rule, which has to find the variant files
beside a listed asset, and the asset bundle, which groups the files it bundles
into assets and their variants. Both must agree, and both must agree with
flutter_tools, which finds a variant by the name of the directory it is in.

def variant_scale(directory):
    """The scale a directory name stands for, or None for any other name.

    flutter_tools (`asset.dart`) takes a directory for a resolution variant's
    when its name matches `/?(\\d+(\\.\\d*)?)x$` and reads the scale from the
    match. The pattern is not anchored at the start, so `icons2x` is a `2x`
    directory too; that is kept, because a directory that is one for
    `flutter build` has to be one here for the same app to bundle the same
    files.

    Args:
        directory: The name of one directory (no `/`).

    Returns:
        The scale as a float (`"1.5x"` is 1.5, `"2x"` is 2.0), or None.
