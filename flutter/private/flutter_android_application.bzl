"""Flutter Android application bundling.

Produces the native artifacts needed for an Android APK:
- libapp.so (AOT-compiled Dart code), as a native library of the APK
- the app's other native libraries (FFI, Native Assets)
- the flutter_assets/ tree, at `<name>/assets/flutter_assets/`

The user wires these outputs into rules_android's android_binary:

    load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl", "flutter_android_bundle")

    flutter_application(
        name = "my_app_flutter",
        main = "main.dart",
    )

    flutter_android_bundle(
        name = "my_app_android",
        application = ":my_app_flutter",
    )

    filegroup(
        name = "my_app_flutter_assets",
        srcs = [":my_app_android"],
        output_group = "flutter_assets",
    )

    # Put the bundle in android_binary's `deps`: it provides its native
    # libraries as `AndroidNativeLibsInfo`, as an `aar_import` does. Its
    # flutter_assets tree goes in `assets`.
    android_binary(
        name = "my_app",
        manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
        assets = [":my_app_flutter_assets"],
        assets_dir = "assets",
        nocompress_extensions = [".so"],
        deps = [":my_app_android", ...],
        ...
    )

The bundle's native libraries are one zip of `lib/<abi>/<name>` entries,
stored uncompressed: `libapp.so`, the `native_deps` libraries and the code
assets that ship (in a release or profile build, those the packages' link
hooks keep). `android_binary` builds its dependencies once for each platform
of `--@rules_android//flags:android_platforms` and merges each build's zip
into the APK. The zip is also the `native_libs` output group.

The bundle is built for whichever Android platform `android_binary` builds it
for, and takes its ABI from that platform, so the application behind it (its
AOT compile and any FFI/native deps) is built for the same one. Every native
library is validated to be an ELF shared object with the ABI's machine type
before the APK is packaged; a host-format binary is a hard build error.
`flutter_android_bundle`, the macro in android.bzl, makes the bundle
incompatible with any platform that is not Android arm, arm64 or x86_64:
building it there fails as incompatible, and `bazel build //...` skips it.
