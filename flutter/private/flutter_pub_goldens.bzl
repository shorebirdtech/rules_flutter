"""The golden service the integration tests of a build share.

Compares the goldens of an integration test for its host runner, which has no
`dart:ui`: started by the runner, told which test it compares for. It needs only
`package:flutter_test`, of which the build has one copy
(`flutter_pub_lib__flutter_test`), so one service serves every
`flutter_pub.from_lock()` hub that lists `flutter_test`. A hub's `goldens/`
package aliases it.

Made only when some lock lists `flutter_test`. Loaded lazily: it is parsed when
an integration test asks for it.
