"""Compile a Flutter plugin's Windows C++ sources into a runner-link-input.

Wraps the plugin's Windows source layout (`windows/*.cpp`,
`windows/include/`) in a custom provider so the Windows runner's
`cc_common.compile()` can fold them in with the right Flutter Windows
engine + Windows SDK include paths.

Public Tier-2 API: re-exported from `flutter/windows.bzl` so users can
wire a monorepo plugin's BUILD.bazel without going through the `flutter/ext/`
overlay system. For pub.dev plugins, `flutter_pub_package` emits this
automatically when `windows/**/*.{cc,cpp,c,h,hh,hpp}` sources are
detected.

Kept distinct from flutter_linux_plugin_library: the two platforms
diverge in include layout, link libs, and runner integration; unifying
would push that divergence into per-rule conditionals.
