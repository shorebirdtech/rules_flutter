A `flutter_font_family` is one entry of `fonts:`, and each of its `fonts` one
`asset:` of it. A plain file stands for a font with no weight and no style; a
`flutter_font` gives one either. The library, plugin or pub package that lists
the family bundles its fonts, keyed by their path from that package's root as
every other asset of the package is.
