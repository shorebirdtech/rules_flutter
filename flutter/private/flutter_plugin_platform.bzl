Each target is one entry of a pubspec's `flutter: plugin: platforms:`, its
attributes the entry's keys in snake case. Its `lib` is the platform's native
library, analysed only in a build for that platform: a plugin whose iOS and
macOS code is one library (`sharedDarwinSource`) names that library in both.
An Android plugin's Kotlin or Java is the plugin's `exports` instead, the one
attribute rules_android's dexing follows to it.
