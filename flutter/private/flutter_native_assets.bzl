"""Code assets: what a program loads, and its native-assets manifests.

An app ships `flutter_assets/NativeAssetsManifest.json`, which the engine
reads at startup, as `flutter build` ships it. It maps each code asset that
ships to how the engine loads it (`["absolute", <path>]` for a bundled
library, `["system", <uri>]`, `["executable"]`, `["process"]`), per Dart
target:

    {
      "format-version": [1, 0, 0],
      "native-assets": {
        "macos_arm64": {
          "package:objective_c/objective_c.dylib": ["absolute", "objective_c.dylib"],
          "package:libsqlite3/libsqlite3.so": ["system", "libsqlite3.so.0"]
        }
      }
    }

A release build's link hooks choose which code assets ship, so the app's
manifest is written by an action (`code_assets.dart manifest`), and each
platform's bundler places the libraries from the same reading of the program's
assets. A bundled library is named by its path in the platform's code-asset
directory:

  * macOS:   `<App>.app/Contents/Frameworks/<basename>`
  * iOS:     `<App>.app/Frameworks/<name>.framework/<name>`: iOS forbids loose
             embedded dylibs, so each library is wrapped in a framework of its
             own (flutter_tools' `frameworkUri`)
  * Linux:   `<bundle>/lib/<basename>`
  * Windows: next to the runner exe
  * Android: `lib/<abi>/<basename>` inside the APK

Several asset ids may name one library. It is bundled once, one file or one
framework on iOS, and every id's entry names it, so the loader opens one image
for all of them.

A `flutter_test` keeps upstream's `flutter test` route: its manifest, written
here (`write_native_assets_manifest`), is compiled into its kernel through the
frontend_server's `--native-assets`.

Each entry provides `DartCodeAssetInfo`: a `dart_code_asset`, a
`flutter_native_library` wrapping one, or any rule that provides it. An entry is
this program's choice of library for its asset id, so it replaces whatever the
packages in `deps` supply under that id, as
`code_assets` does on rules_dart's `dart_binary` and `dart_test`. Ids no entry
names keep the asset `deps` supply.

Several entries may name one library, to serve several packages' ids from one
shared library. It is bundled once (one file; one framework on iOS) and every
id's manifest entry names it, so the process loads one image of it: one copy of
its static state, whichever id a call goes through.

    Assets arrive two ways, and on a shared id the more deliberate one wins:

      * named in the consuming target's own `code_assets` — a choice made for
        this program, so it replaces whatever arrives under its id below.
        rules_dart's `dart_binary` and `dart_test` give their `code_assets` the
        same meaning;
      * owned by a Dart package (its `dart_package_metadata`'s `code_assets`)
        and lifted off the package graph, the program's own package among
        them.

    Two packages claiming one id with different libraries fail, as in
    rules_dart, unless the target names the one to use: the Dart VM resolves
    an id to exactly one library, and keeping either would pick a native
    library by graph-traversal order.

    Several ids may name one library, as when one shared library serves
    several packages. They share one staged file, so every bundle carries the
    library once and every manifest entry names that one file, and the OS
    loader returns one image — one copy of the library's static state — for
    all of them. Two files would load two copies.

    A library is staged under a directory named after the consuming target,
    because the bare basename in its package is a path someone else may
    already own: the library's own rule, when it sits in the same package (a
    `cc_shared_library` named `sub` writes `libsub.dylib` there), or a second
    application in the package whose action differs. It also takes the
    library out of `_solib_<arch>/`, which trips rules_apple's
    `bundle_paths.owner_relative_path`. Every bundler places the library by its
    basename, which this keeps.

    The assets are every one the program's unlinked assets operation
    (`dart_program_assets_actions`) can load, known at analysis time as the
    kernel compile's `--native-assets` needs them. A package's
    `linked_code_assets` are linked for this program there.

      ctx: The consuming rule's context, carrying `program_assets_attrs()`,

        None for a program in no package. Its `code_assets` count as any
        package's, whether or not a library in `deps` names the same
        declaration.
      deps: Targets whose Dart packages may carry code assets.
      code_assets: `DartCodeAssetInfo` the target names itself.

      None), `bundle_filename` (its basename, or empty) and `uri`; and
