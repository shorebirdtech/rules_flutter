    """The Targets a rule's attributes hold.

    An aspect visits rules it does not own, and an attribute named like a list
    of dependencies may hold a single label: `resolved_package`'s `deps` holds
    the one target a resolve-mapped pub package stands for. An attribute the
    rule lacks, or one that holds no label, contributes nothing.

    Args:
      rule_attr: `ctx.rule.attr` of the aspect's context.

      A list of Targets, in attribute order.
