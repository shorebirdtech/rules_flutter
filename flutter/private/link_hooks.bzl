"""What a program ships, through its packages' link hooks or not.

Native and web applications choose it the same way, as `flutter build`
does for every target: in a release or profile build every package with a
`hook/link.dart` has it run over the uses the compiler recorded, and a hook
receives its own package's declared assets and decides which ship; a debug
build runs no hook and ships every package's declared assets. What differs
between targets is only which compile records the uses. rules_dart's
`dart_program_assets_actions` is the operation; this module decides when it
links and hands it the program.

    The compile that records the uses has to be told to, so this is asked
    first, and `program_assets` takes the answer after.

    Every package of the program counts, its own among them: a link hook
    of the app's package runs whether or not a library of that package is
    in `deps`, as upstream's hooks runner plans the root package with the
    rest. A package that links native code into each program keeps what
    the uses need, so it counts too.

    Args:
        program: The program, from `flutter_program_inputs`.
        deps: The `deps` whose closure is linked (a web branch's, on web).
        links: Whether the build mode links: not a debug build.

    one of its packages either way.

    Args:
