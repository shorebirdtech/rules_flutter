"""The Flutter release the toolchain pins, as a constant rules can load.

A rule that compiles a program learns the release from its toolchain. A rule
whose dependencies are compiled as modules (`flutter_test`) must know it before
that, as configuration, from its attributes alone: the modules compile in the
same environment as the program, and `FlutterVersion` is part of it. This
repository is where such a rule reads it.
