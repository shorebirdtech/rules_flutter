"""An app's version: Flutter's build name and build number, for every platform.

`flutter build --build-name <name> --build-number <number>` (or the
`version: <name>+<number>` of `pubspec.yaml`) sets one version, and each
platform's build turns it into its own fields:

    Android        versionName                  versionCode
    iOS, macOS     CFBundleShortVersionString   CFBundleVersion
    Web            version.json "version"       version.json "build_number"

The app macros take the same two arguments. Unset, they are `flutter create`'s
`1.0.0+1`: build name `1.0.0`, build number `1`.

Each platform checks the value the way `flutter_tools` does (`build_info.dart`,
`validatedBuildNameForPlatform` and `validatedBuildNumberForPlatform`), with
one difference: where `flutter_tools` quietly rewrites a value it cannot use
(`1.0-beta` becomes `1.0.0` on iOS; `0` becomes `1` on Android), the build
fails here and says what the platform accepts. The one rewrite kept is Apple's
padding of a build name to three numbers (`2.1` becomes `2.1.0`), which
`flutter build` does to every valid build name.

The checks run at analysis, in the rules that use the values, so a value may
be a `select()`. Inside one, an empty string or `None` picks the default.

Every function returns a struct of the platform's values and an `error`
string, `None` when the values are good; the rule fails with the error. That
keeps the checks testable without failing a build.
