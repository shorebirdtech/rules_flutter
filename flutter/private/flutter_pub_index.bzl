"""How the repositories `flutter_pub.from_lock()` makes find each other.

There is one repository per package for the whole build, however many hubs
(`flutter_pub.from_lock(name = ...)`) list it. A built package (a hosted
package, or a Flutter SDK package other than `package:flutter`, which
`flutter_pub_package` builds from the pinned Flutter source) is two
repositories, made by the one module extension:

* its source repository, `flutter_pub__<package>` (`flutter_pub_package`): the
  package's files, its `flutter_pub_member` (or rules_dart's
  `pub_package_member`) and the facts it states about itself, which need
  nothing but its own archive;
* its library repository, `flutter_pub_lib__<package>` (`flutter_pub_library_repo`):
  the package's dependency cycle as one library, in the repository of the
  cycle's first package by name, which the others alias. A cycle is built only
  where it is declared (`flutter_pub.cycle()`, or rules_dart's curated ones).

`package:flutter` (`flutter_framework_package`), the stub for a lock entry
nothing supplies, and a package `flutter_pub.from_lock(resolve = ...)` maps to a
workspace target (`flutter_resolved_package`) are each one repository named
`flutter_pub__<package>`, which is its own library.

Library repositories read what source repositories record (their pubspec
dependencies, and `MEMBER_FILE`), which is why the source repositories read
nothing of each other: planning a cycle never asks a repository to wait on
itself. Both are read through canonical names, since Bazel fetches every
repository a label attribute names before the rule runs and only the packages
a cycle reaches are wanted.

What every repository needs to know of the lock, and would otherwise state in
an attribute of its own (growing the lock's record of the repositories with
the square of the package count), is stated once in the one index
repository, over every lock of the build. A hub is only the set of aliases a
user's own lock names.
