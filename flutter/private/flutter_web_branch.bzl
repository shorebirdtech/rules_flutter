"""The compilers a web bundle's Dart goes through, and what each one reads.

A web bundle compiles one program with up to three compilers, and the program
may differ between them: a library's `deps` can `select()` on
`@rules_dart//dart/constraints:wasm` or `:js`, so a dependency that holds an
`Int64List` for dart2wasm can be a `List<int>` for dart2js. The bundle
therefore reads each compiler's inputs from a *branch* of its dependencies,
built for that compiler's web platform:

    branch     compiles                              platform
    dart2wasm  the WebAssembly build                 wasm_platform
    dart2js    the JavaScript fallback               js_platform
    ddc        the dev loop (`flutter_bazel run`)    js_platform

Two branches share a platform, so a debug bundle has at most two
configurations of its program: DDC compiles what dart2js does.

Each branch is its own configured target of `flutter_web_branch`, because the
staging a compile needs (the package config and the co-located sources of a
package whose files are split between the source tree and `bazel-out`) declares
files named after its target, and two of them in one target collide. The
bundle macro (`flutter_web_bundle`) declares that target beside the bundle.
