"""Common Flutter application compilation pipeline.

Chains: sources → kernel .dill → AOT native code → asset bundle.

In debug mode (-c dbg): produces kernel .dill + assets (JIT, no gen_snapshot).
In fastbuild/opt mode: produces AOT native code + assets (release).
With -c opt and `--@rules_flutter//flutter:profile`: AOT for profile mode,
compiled by the profile gen_snapshot the toolchain selects.

This rule produces outputs that platform-specific wrappers consume:
1. AOT compiled native code (.so/.dylib) or kernel .dill (debug)
2. flutter_assets/ tree artifact
3. ICU data file (icudtl.dat)
