"""Who builds a `pubspec.lock` entry, decided by the entry's `source:` alone.

The lock's `source:` says where pub got the package. A hosted package is fetched
from its registry. An `sdk: flutter` package is Flutter's own, and pub writes
one for every `sdk: flutter` package the app's dependencies reach, not only the
ones the app names: `integration_test` brings `flutter_driver`, which brings
`fuchsia_remote_debug_protocol`. A list of package names would be wrong the day
a Flutter release adds one, so the only names this file knows are the two `sdk`
packages that are not built like the rest. A `path` package is the user's own,
built by the target `flutter_pub.from_lock(resolve = ...)` names for it. A `git`
package is fetched at the commit the lock records and built like a hosted one.
