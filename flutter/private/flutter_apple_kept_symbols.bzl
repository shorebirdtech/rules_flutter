"""Keeps the global symbols of a Swift package's `.dynamic` product in the app.

`flutter build` embeds a `.dynamic` product as a framework, whose global
symbols all stay, and Dart looks them up with `DynamicLibrary.process()`.
rules_flutter links the product's code into the app, whose release link
removes code nothing references. This rule forwards a library as it is and
adds to its link a response file of `-Wl,-u,<symbol>` for each global symbol
the archives of the plugin's package define, which makes each a root for that removal. Every
other symbol of the app is left to it.
