"""`flutter_android_release`: sign an App Bundle and its APK with the upload key.

rules_android signs only with its debug key, and has no release signing by
design: a key handed to a build action reaches Bazel's action keys, caches and
remote executors. This rule builds the App Bundle in release mode and gives
`bazel run` a program that signs it on this machine, reading the keystore and
its passwords from the `key.properties` file Flutter's own deployment docs
describe. The rule takes no keystore, no password and no `key.properties`
label, so none of them can enter the build graph.

    bazel run //:app_release                 # sign
    bazel run //:app_release -- create-key   # make the upload keystore

The program, `flutter/private/tools/android_release.dart`, writes
`build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` and
`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` under the target's package, as
`flutter build appbundle` and `flutter build apk` do.
