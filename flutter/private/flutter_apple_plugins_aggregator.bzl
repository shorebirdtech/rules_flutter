"""Aggregates Apple plugin libraries from a Flutter application's
transitive dep graph into a single CcInfo + SwiftInfo target so the
runner's swift_library can depend on it.

flutter_application transitively merges per-plugin
`apple_plugin_libraries` entries into FlutterApplicationInfo. Each entry holds the
CcInfo and SwiftInfo from a flutter_apple_plugin_library spoke. This
rule walks that depset, filters to the target platform, and merges:
  * CcInfo via cc_common.merge_cc_infos — gives the runner the static
    libs to link against and the include paths the registrant Swift
    needs for ObjC interop.
  * SwiftInfo via rules_swift's `SwiftInfo(swift_infos = [...])`
    constructor — gives the runner each plugin's Swift module so the
    generated registrant's `import <PluginModule>` resolves.

A plugin whose `Package.swift` decides its defines from the app is built
here, for this app: the Dart graph names it by a marker, and this rule links
the library the marker names from `@flutter_pub_apple_app_settings//:libraries`,
which it depends on through `swiftpm_app_transition` with the app's
`info_plist` and `swift_package_environment` (`swiftpm_app_settings.bzl`).

The runner_lib_gen swift_library has the aggregator target in its `deps`.
