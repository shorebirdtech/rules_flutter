"""Hub repo rule for `flutter_pub.from_lock()` locks.

Mirrors `rules_dart//dart/pub:pub_lock_hub.bzl`'s top-level alias structure:
`@<hub>//:pkg` aliases the package's library, `@flutter_pub_lib__<pkg>//:<pkg>`
for a built package (whose dependency cycle is built as one target) and
`@flutter_pub__<pkg>//:<pkg>` for the other entries. Those repositories are the
build's, one per package however many hubs list it; the hub is the set of
labels the user's own lock(s) name, so a target reaches only what its lock
states.

It also has an `android/` package, aliasing the build's Maven data an Android
app checks the plugins it links against, and, for a lock with `flutter_test`, a
`goldens/` package aliasing the golden service the integration tests share.

`flutter_android_app` links the Android libraries of the plugins its
application depends on (`flutter_android_plugin_libs`), not those of every
package of the lock, and passes that rule `@<hub>//android:maven_requirements`.

Loaded lazily: Bazel only parses `android/BUILD.bazel` when an Android build
asks for it. Non-Android workspaces (mac-only, web-only) don't pay the
`@rules_android` / `@rules_kotlin` cost.

This rule is the rules_flutter sibling of rules_dart's `pub_lock_hub`; the two
never run for the same hub. `flutter_pub.from_lock()` always invokes this one.
`pub.pub()` (in non-Flutter modules) keeps using `pub_lock_hub`.
