"""Flutter rules for Android builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_android_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl", "flutter_android_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_android_app(
            name = "my_app_android",
            application = ":my_app",
            application_id = "com.example.myapp",
            app_bundle = "my_app_bundle",
        )

        # `bazel run :my_app_release` signs the App Bundle and an APK with
        # the upload key in android/key.properties, as `flutter build
        # appbundle` and `flutter build apk` do.
        flutter_android_release(name = "my_app_release", app_bundle = ":my_app_bundle")

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=android .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `android/app/src/main/` directory with
    AndroidManifest.xml, resources, and Kotlin sources. The macro handles everything
    automatically — no edits to the flutter create output needed.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl",
            "ANDROID_MIN_SDK_VERSION",
            "ANDROID_TARGET_SDK_VERSION",
            "flutter_android_build",
            "flutter_android_bundle",
            "flutter_android_engine",
            "flutter_android_manifest_gen",
            "flutter_android_manifest_merge",
            "flutter_android_release",
            "flutter_android_runner_lib_gen")

        flutter_android_bundle(name = "my_bundle", application = ":my_app")
        filegroup(name = "my_native_libs_files", srcs = [":my_bundle"], output_group = "native_libs")
        cc_library(name = "my_native_libs", srcs = [":my_native_libs_files"])
        flutter_android_engine(name = "my_engine")
        flutter_android_manifest_gen(name = "my_manifest", application_id = "com.example.myapp")

        flutter_android_runner_lib_gen(
            name = "my_runner",
            namespace = "com.example.myapp",
            engine = ":my_engine",
        )

        android_binary(
            name = "my_apk",
            manifest = ":my_manifest",
            # Stored uncompressed, as the manifest's
            # android:extractNativeLibs="false" requires.
            nocompress_extensions = [".so"],
            deps = [":my_native_libs", ":my_engine", ":my_runner"],
        )

    The App Bundle is rules_android's `android_application` from the same
    arguments, with rules_flutter's bundle configuration:

        android_application(
            name = "my_bundle",
            bundle_config_file = "@rules_flutter//flutter:android_bundle_config.pb.json",
            manifest = ":my_manifest",
            manifest_values = {"applicationId": "com.example.myapp"},
            nocompress_extensions = [".so"],
            deps = [":my_native_libs", ":my_engine", ":my_runner"],
        )

        flutter_android_release(name = "my_release", app_bundle = ":my_bundle")

    rules_android runs R8 only for an `android_binary` with `proguard_specs`.
    `flutter_android_app` gives a release build
    `@rules_flutter//flutter:android_proguard_rules.pro`, as `flutter build
    --release` shrinks; give your own binary the same to match it.

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `android/app/src/main/`
    directory (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=android .`) and
    wires up all internal targets automatically.

    The ABIs of the APK are those of `--@rules_android//flags:android_platforms`, as for any
    `android_binary`: one platform builds an APK for that ABI, several build one
    APK for all of them (`flutter build apk`'s fat APK). The Flutter engine, the
    app's `libapp.so`, the AARs' native libraries and any C++ deps are each
    packaged for every ABI. Name the platforms rules_android ships,
    `@rules_android//:armeabi-v7a`, `@rules_android//:arm64-v8a` and
    `@rules_android//:x86_64`:

        bazel build //:my_app_android --@rules_android//flags:android_platforms=@rules_android//:arm64-v8a

    With no `--@rules_android//flags:android_platforms`, rules_android builds for `--platforms`, the
    host's, and the build fails naming the flag. To fix the ABI of a target
    regardless of the command line, as a test does, wrap it in
    `flutter_android_build`.

    Three modes, and which one an app is in decides what it can express:
      1. `manifest` provided → uses it directly, with **no** `${...}`
         placeholder preprocessing and no resource/Kotlin auto-discovery.
         Handing this attribute the same `android/app/src/main/`
         AndroidManifest.xml mode 2 would have discovered therefore fails —
         `flutter create` writes `android:name="${applicationName}"` and
         nothing substitutes it. Use mode 2 for `flutter create` output;
         mode 1 is for a manifest you wrote yourself.
      2. android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml found → uses flutter create
         manifest (preprocessed for Gradle variables), discovers resources
         and Kotlin sources from android/app/src/main/. The main manifest is
         used in **every** compilation mode.
      3. No manifest found → generates manifest from template.

    `permissions` adds `<uses-permission>` elements to the effective manifest
    in every mode and every compilation mode, so it is the answer in all
    three — see the attribute's documentation below.

    Debug variant manifests (the Gradle merge Bazel lacks): flutter create
    declares `android.permission.INTERNET` only in
    `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`. Without it a debug APK
    cannot host the Dart VM service (Android enforces INTERNET at the
    kernel level via AID_INET), so hot reload and debugging are impossible.
    This macro folds the debug variant into `-c dbg` APKs, controlled by
    `debug_manifest`:
      - None (default) → discover android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml;
        when present, its permissions are merged into the main manifest for
        `-c dbg` builds only. Requires a main manifest (mode 1 or 2).
      - a label → merge that variant manifest instead of discovering one.
      - False → no debug variant handling, even if the file exists.
    Release (`-c opt`, the default) APKs always use the main manifest
    unchanged — so a `flutter create` app that networks perfectly in `-c dbg`
    has **no** `INTERNET` permission in release, and Android enforces that at
    the kernel level (AID_INET group membership): every socket fails with
    `EACCES`, with no build error and no diagnostic. The dbg-only grant is a
    *debugging* requirement, not the app's network grant. An app that
    networks must declare it for itself, via `permissions`.
    `profile_manifest` does the same for profile builds (`-c opt` with
    `--@rules_flutter//flutter:profile`), from
    android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml, which `flutter create`
    writes with the `INTERNET` permission the VM service needs.

    The runner's sources, where Gradle looks for them (Kotlin under
    android/app/src/main/kotlin/ or java/, Java under java/, as
    `flutter create --android-language java` writes it), are compiled via
    kt_android_library with the Flutter engine and AndroidX deps.

    Plugin auto-wiring:
      - Generates a `flutter_android_registrant` target whose application is
        `application`, then compiles the resulting Java into a private
        `kt_android_library` that goes into `binary_deps`. Every plugin
        whose `flutter.plugin.platforms.android.pluginClass` is set ends up
        registered with the FlutterEngine on startup — no manual wiring.
      - Links the Kotlin/Java sources (and resources) of the plugins
        `application` depends on, and of those only
        (`flutter_android_plugin_libs`): the `exports` each plugin
        selects on Android. A plugin the lock lists and the application does
        not use contributes no code, no manifest entries and no Maven
        requirements to the APK.
      - Checks the Maven artifacts the Gradle builds of those plugins
        declare against `@rules_flutter_maven`, failing with every one the
        app lacks, by name.
      - Permissions that plugins and AARs declare in their own manifests
        (e.g. record_android's RECORD_AUDIO) are lifted into the app's
        manifest, as AGP merges them. Bazel's own merger drops library
        permissions unless `--merge_android_manifest_permissions` is set;
        the app no longer depends on that flag.

    Args:
        name: Target name (Bazel identifier). Produces an android_binary.
        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        application_id: The application id, e.g. "com.example.myapp", as
            Gradle's `applicationId` (required).
        namespace: The package the runner's code lives in, as Gradle's
            `namespace` (and AGP's R class package) in build.gradle.
            Defaults to `application_id`, which `flutter create` sets equal
            to it. Set it when the runner declares another package, e.g.
            one runner shipped under several application ids. The
            manifest's relative class names (`.MainActivity`,
            `.sub.Receiver`, a bare `MainActivity`) are written out in
            full against it, as AGP does; qualified names are untouched.
        app_name: User-facing display name. Defaults to name.
        min_sdk_version: Minimum Android SDK version.
        target_sdk_version: Target Android SDK version.
        manifest: Override AndroidManifest.xml. If not set, auto-discovered
            from android/app/src/main/ or generated from template.
        debug_manifest: Debug variant manifest merged into `-c dbg` APKs.
            None (default) discovers android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml;
            a label overrides discovery; False disables variant handling.
        profile_manifest: Profile variant manifest merged into profile APKs.
            None (default) discovers android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml;
            a label overrides discovery; False disables variant handling.
        permissions: Permission names — e.g.
            `["android.permission.INTERNET"]` — added to the effective
            manifest in **every** compilation mode and in all three manifest
            modes. This is what a networked app needs: `flutter create`
            grants `INTERNET` in the debug variant only, so without this the
            release APK cannot open a socket. A permission the manifest
            already declares is not duplicated. For a permission wanted in
            `-c dbg` alone, use `debug_manifest` instead; this attribute is
            consumed by the macro and cannot be a `select()`.
        resources: Extra resource_files for android_binary.
        deps: Extra deps for android_binary (e.g. custom android_library).
            A plugin written in the workspace goes here as its
            `flutter_android_plugin_library`: the registrant compiles
            against these too, so the plugin is both packaged and
            registered. Pub plugins arrive through the hub instead.
        build_name: versionName, as `flutter build --build-name`. Defaults to
            `1.0.0`. May be a `select()`, whose `None` is the default.
            Unset, the `application`'s `build_name`. Set, the
            `application` must set the same.
        build_number: versionCode, as `flutter build --build-number`: a
            whole number from 1 to 2100000000, Google Play's limit. Defaults
            to `1`. May be a `select()`.
            Unset, the `application`'s `build_number`. Set, the
            `application` must set the same. A manifest that declares
            `android:versionCode` or `android:versionName` itself keeps it
            while the matching argument is unset, and is an error once it
            is set.
        manifest_values: `android_binary`'s `manifest_values`: values for
            the manifest's `${...}` placeholders. The macro sets
            `applicationId`, `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` from
            `application_id`, `min_sdk_version` and `target_sdk_version`, so
            naming them here is an error. `versionCode` and `versionName`
            are allowed while `build_number` and `build_name` are unset.
            Other keys pass through. A dict, not a `select()`.
        proguard_specs: The R8 configuration of the APK. By default a
            release build (`-c opt` without
            `--@rules_flutter//flutter:profile`) is shrunk with R8 as
            `flutter build apk --release` shrinks it:
            `@rules_flutter//flutter:android_proguard_rules.pro` (the Android
            Gradle plugin's proguard-android-optimize.txt and Flutter's
            rules), then `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` when `flutter
            create`'s directory has one; debug and profile builds are not
            shrunk. A list (or `select()`) replaces that whole default, in
            every compilation mode; `[]` turns R8 off. Resources are shrunk
            whenever R8 runs, unless `shrink_resources = False` is passed.
        app_bundle: When set, also declare an App Bundle of this app named
            `app_bundle`, built by rules_android's `android_application` from
            the same arguments as the APK. Its output is the unsigned
            `<app_bundle>_unsigned.aab`, for the ABIs and compilation mode of
            the build like the APK's. `bazel run` of it installs it on the
            device `ANDROID_SERIAL` names with bundletool, signed with the
            debug key. Hand it to `flutter_android_release` to sign a release.
        bundle_config: The bundletool `BundleConfig` (`.pb.json`) of
            `app_bundle`. The default,
            `@rules_flutter//flutter:android_bundle_config.pb.json`, is the
            Android Gradle plugin's: split by ABI, screen density and
            language, with native libraries and dex stored uncompressed and
            the libraries 16 KB-aligned. Setting it replaces the default.
        **kwargs: Passed through to android_binary, except `testonly`, which
            every target the macro declares has, since one that depends on a
            `testonly` application would otherwise fail analysis.
