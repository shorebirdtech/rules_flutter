"""Collects what a hot restart reads of an iOS app, without building the app.

A restart needs two things of the app it is restarting: the `flutter_assets`
tree, to see whether an asset moved, and the native code the app carries, to
see whether the process must be replaced rather than restarted. Building the
app to read them costs far more than they do: a debug `App.framework` holds the
app's kernel, so every Dart edit recompiles the whole program into it, and the
app is then signed and packaged, while a restart compiles the same edit itself,
in the resident compiler.

An aspect reaches through the launch target (`flutter_ios_app`, then rules_apple's
`ios_application`), transitions included, and meets each dependency in the
configuration the app really used. Building only its output groups builds only
what they hold:

    bazel build <launch target> \\
        --aspects=@rules_flutter//flutter:ios_bundle_parts.bzl%flutter_ios_bundle_parts_aspect \\
        --output_groups=flutter_ios_bundle_parts,flutter_ios_native_libs

`flutter_ios_bundle_parts` holds the application's `flutter_assets` tree, as
the `flutter_ios_framework` that puts it into `App.framework` reads it.

`flutter_ios_native_libs` holds what the app's native code is made from: the
libraries a `flutter_ios_native_frameworks` wraps into frameworks (the
application's `native_deps` and its bundled code assets), and the linker inputs
(archives, objects and shared libraries) of every `CcInfo` dependency, which
covers the runner, the plugins linked into it, and any framework the app
embeds. A change to any of them is a change to code the running process has
already loaded. An exec configuration is left out, since a tool the build runs
is not in the app.

The simulator and a device are the same app built for different SDKs, so one
aspect serves both.
