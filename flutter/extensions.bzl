"""Extensions for bzlmod.

`flutter` installs the Flutter SDKs and their toolchains. The pub dependency
extension is `pub` in `@rules_flutter//flutter/pub:extensions.bzl`; it is its
own extension so that a lock it refuses breaks only the builds that use its
repositories, never the toolchains, and `bazel run @rules_flutter//flutter/pub`,
which fixes the lock, still runs.

Every module can ask for a toolchain version under the default name, "flutter",
which rules_flutter always registers. The root module's version is the one
used; without one, the highest version any module asks for is used.

The root module can declare more toolchains under other names (each name
resolved the same way) and register them as it sees fit, overriding the default
one by toolchain resolution precedence.
