"""Integration tests: `package:integration_test` suites run in an app on a device, reported per test.

An integration test is run as the application with its test as the program
(`flutter_application_variant`, whose `main` is the generated
`flutter_integration_bootstrap`), and the host drives the suite it runs over the
app's VM service, as `flutter test integration_test/x_test.dart -d <device>`
does, or, for a web app, which has none, over the browser's DevTools protocol. Each `testWidgets` is a test case: `--test_filter`, `shard_count` and the
JUnit report see each one.

Tier 1, the convenience macros: one per platform, each composing the bootstrap,
the variant, the platform's app rule and the test.

- `flutter_macos_integration_test`
- `flutter_windows_integration_test`
- `flutter_linux_integration_test`
- `flutter_web_integration_test`
- `flutter_android_integration_test`
- `flutter_ios_simulator_integration_test`

Tier 2, the composable rules:

- `flutter_integration_bootstrap`: the program an integration test file runs as.
- `flutter_application_variant`: a `flutter_application` rebuilt with another
  `main`, plus extra `srcs`, `deps` and `defines`.
- `flutter_desktop_app_integration_test`: runs a desktop app on the host's desktop.
- `flutter_desktop_runner`: where it runs, and on Linux the runtime it runs with.
- `flutter_web_app_integration_test`: runs a web bundle in a headless Chrome.
- `flutter_chrome_runner`: a headless Chrome of its own, where a web test runs.
- `flutter_linux_runtime`: on Linux, the X server, GTK, Mesa and libraries a
  runner runs the app or browser with, from pinned Debian packages.
- `flutter_android_app_integration_test`: runs an Android app on an emulator or
  an attached device.
- `flutter_android_emulator_runner`: an emulator of the test's own, of a pinned
  emulator and system image.
- `flutter_android_system_image`: a system image that emulator boots.
- `flutter_android_device_runner`: an attached device, and which `adb` drives it.
- `flutter_ios_app_integration_test`: runs an iOS app on a simulator of its own.
- `flutter_ios_simulator_runner`: which simulator that is.
