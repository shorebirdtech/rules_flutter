"""Flutter rules for iOS builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_ios_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl", "flutter_ios_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_ios_app(
            name = "my_app_ios",
            application = ":my_app",
            bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
        )

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=ios .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `ios/Runner/` directory with AppDelegate.swift
    and SceneDelegate.swift.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl",
            "IOS_DEFAULT_LAUNCH_STORYBOARD",
            "flutter_ios_engine",
            "flutter_ios_app_framework_gen",
            "flutter_ios_info_plist_gen",
            "flutter_ios_registrant_gen",
            "flutter_ios_runner_lib_gen")

        flutter_ios_app_framework_gen(name = "my_framework", application = ":my_app")
        flutter_ios_registrant_gen(name = "my_registrant", application = ":my_app")
        flutter_ios_engine(name = "my_engine")
        flutter_ios_info_plist_gen(name = "my_info_plist", app_name = "My App")

        flutter_ios_runner_lib_gen(
            name = "my_runner",
            registrant = ":my_registrant",
            engine = ":my_engine",
        )

        ios_application(
            name = "my_ios_app",
            bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
            infoplists = [":my_info_plist"],

                # cannot resolve any native asset at runtime.
                ":my_native_frameworks",
                ":my_runner",
            ],
        )

    """Builds a Flutter iOS .app bundle from a flutter_application target.

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `ios/Runner/` directory
    (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=ios .`) and wires up all
    internal targets automatically.

    Prerequisites — the package must contain:
        - `ios/Runner/*.swift` (AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, etc.)
    Generate these with: `flutter create --platforms=ios .`

    Simulator builds need no code signing. A device build needs
    `provisioning_profile`, and fails at analysis, saying so, without one. That
    holds for an app that is not signed in this build as well: rules_apple
    takes the bundle's `embedded.mobileprovision` and its entitlements from the
    profile, also when signing is left for later (see below). See the README's
    "Running on an iOS device" for how to obtain a profile without an Xcode
    project.

    To leave signing for later, as `flutter build ios --no-codesign` does for a
    CI that holds no signing identity, build with
    `--features=disable_legacy_signing`: the `.ipa` is unsigned, and
    rules_apple's `combined_dossier_zip` output group holds what
    `dossier_codesigningtool` signs it with elsewhere. Unlike
    `--no-codesign`, this still wants the profile.

    Non-release builds carry two extra `Info.plist` keys —
    `NSBonjourServices` and `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` — so the engine
    can advertise the Dart VM service over mDNS, matching flutter_tools'
    `xcode_backend.dart`. Release builds drop them, which is correct: they
    exist for the debugger, not for the app. An app that needs iOS 14+ Local
    Network Privacy for *itself* must declare `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`
    (and its own `NSBonjourServices`) in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, where it
    survives into release; the macro merges the VM service keys into that
    plist rather than beside it, so the app's own values win and its Bonjour
    service list is preserved.

    Args:
        name: Target name (Bazel identifier). The runner's Swift module name
            is derived from it, so it must be a bare Swift identifier.
        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        bundle_id: CFBundleIdentifier (required — rules_apple constraint).
        families: Device families (default ["iphone"]; `flutter create` targets iPhone and iPad. An iPhone-only app runs in a small window on iPadOS. Adding "ipad" makes actool reject the 76x76@1x icon in `flutter create`'s icon set, so drop that entry first).
        app_name: User-facing display name. Defaults to name.
        minimum_os_version: Minimum iOS version.
        info_plist: Override conventional ios/Runner/Info.plist. The macro
            substitutes `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME)` in either with the runner's
            module name, and `$(DEVELOPMENT_LANGUAGE)` with `en`; a plist
            that spells `UISceneDelegateClassName` out as
            `Runner.SceneDelegate` will not find the scene delegate. Keep the
            `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME)` variable, or write `<name>.SceneDelegate`.
            The plist leaves `CFBundleShortVersionString` and
            `CFBundleVersion` to the app's version: a literal value there
            that differs from it fails the build. No key, the version
            itself, `$(FLUTTER_BUILD_NAME)` and `$(FLUTTER_BUILD_NUMBER)` as
            `flutter create` writes them, and Xcode's `$(MARKETING_VERSION)`
            and `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` pass.
        version: An `apple_bundle_version` (or `flutter_apple_bundle_version`)
            target, rules_apple's own way to set the version, to give the
            app's extensions the same one. Its values must be the
            `application`'s, which the program reports as `appBuildName` and
            `appBuildNumber`: a bundle version that differs fails the build.
            A `flutter_apple_bundle_version` with the same `application`
            takes them. Setting it with `build_name` or `build_number` is an
            error.
        build_name: CFBundleShortVersionString, as `flutter build
            --build-name`: numbers separated by periods, padded to three
            as `flutter build` pads them (`2.1` is `2.1.0`). Defaults to
            `1.0.0`. May be a `select()`, whose `None` is the default.
            Unset, the `application`'s `build_name`. Set, the
            `application` must set the same.
        build_number: CFBundleVersion, as `flutter build --build-number`:
            numbers separated by periods. Defaults to `1`. May be a
            `select()`.
            Unset, the `application`'s `build_number`. Set, the
            `application` must set the same.
        launch_storyboard: Override launch storyboard. Defaults to
            ios/Runner/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard.
        entitlements: Override entitlements wiring. By default the macro
            auto-discovers `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` and forwards
            it to `ios_application`. Unlike macOS (where flutter create
            always emits the entitlements files), iOS only ships
            Runner.entitlements when capabilities are enabled in Xcode;
            its absence is a valid, capability-less app and the macro
            ships nothing rather than synthesizing a default. Pass `False`
            to ship none although the file exists — a device build is
            signed against a profile, and an entitlement the profile does
            not grant fails it: `aps-environment`, which Xcode writes when
            Push is enabled, cannot be granted by a team wildcard profile
            at all. rules_apple reports that as "uses entitlements with
            the ... key, but the profile does not have this key", which
            names the profile and not the file — and the file is in the
            build because it is on disk, not because anyone named it.
        additional_entitlements: Entitlement plist files merged into the
            base entitlements in **every** compilation mode — the additive
            seam for an app that needs one more `com.apple.security.*` key
            without taking over `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`. A key the
            base already declares with the same value is deduped; a
            different value is a hard error naming the key and both files.
            Works when the app ships no entitlements file at all, in which
            case the additions become the entitlements.
        provisioning_profile: A `.mobileprovision` file (usually a
            `local_provisioning_profile` target) to sign a device build
            with. Required for device builds (`--ios_multi_cpus=arm64`) and
            unused by simulator builds.
        app_icons: The app icon, as the files of an `.appiconset` or of an
            Icon Composer `.icon` bundle. Defaults to the conventional
            `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` that
            `flutter create` writes — so an app that has never thought about
            this ships the icon it already has on disk, which is what
            `flutter build ios` does with the same tree. Pass a list to name a
            different one; pass `[]` to ship no icon. rules_apple refuses an
            `.appiconset` and a `.icon` bundle together, so name exactly one.
            Discovery is per-platform and its absence is silent: a tree
            that only ever ran `flutter create --platforms=macos .` has no
            catalog here, and an app with neither a catalog nor an
            `app_icons` has said nothing either way, so it ships no icon and
            there is nothing to report.
        resources: Extra resources. Main.storyboard is wired separately,
            through the runner library, so that ibtool resolves its classes
            against the runner's module. Resources passed here are compiled
            against the app target's name instead, which is not a module any
            target produces — so a storyboard listed here cannot reference the
            runner's Swift classes (an `@objc` class name works regardless).
        runner_deps: Extra `swift_library` labels to link into the runner, so
            the runner's sources can `import` them and the binary carries
            their code. Added to the generated `__<name>_runner` library's
            `deps`; `deps` itself is the macro's and cannot be passed through
            **kwargs. For App Intents, pass the library here *and* to
            rules_apple's `app_intents` (which passes through **kwargs):
            `app_intents` only extracts the metadata, it does not link.
        swift_package_environment: The environment in which the
            `Package.swift` of each plugin that decides its defines from the
            app is evaluated, as the shell's environment is under `flutter
            build`: `{"AUDIO_SESSION_MICROPHONE": "1"}` for what
            audio_session's README says to export. Such a manifest is
            evaluated for this app, also seeing the app's Info.plist (see
            the README's "Apple plugins built from their Package.swift").
            Nothing else reads it, and the shell's environment does not
            reach the manifests.
        **kwargs: Passed through to ios_application, except `target_compatible_with`
            and `visibility`, which are the named target's, and `testonly`, which
            every target the macro declares has, since one that depends on a
            `testonly` application would otherwise fail analysis. The app is
            compatible with macOS (which builds it for iOS) and iOS only,
            whatever `target_compatible_with` adds, so `bazel build //...`
            skips it on any other platform. `tags` defaults to
            `["manual"]`, so `bazel build //...` skips the app and every
            target the macro declares for it; pass `tags` to replace that
            on all of them. The macro sets
            `bundle_id`, `bundle_name`, `entitlements`, `families`,
            `minimum_os_version`, `infoplists`, `version`,
            `launch_storyboard`, `resources`, `provisioning_profile`,
            `app_icons` and `deps` itself, so passing any of those
            here is a duplicate-keyword error — use the named parameter
            instead.

    `fastbuild` or `opt` is refused at analysis, and so is one built with
    `--@rules_flutter//flutter:profile` (upstream has no profile simulator
    build either). This forwards the files of `targets` built with `-c dbg`
    and the flag off, for anything that needs a simulator bundle under a
    default `bazel test //...`: a `build_test`, or a test that reads
    the bundle through `data`. The files keep their runfiles paths.

    Args:
        name: Target name.
        targets: `flutter_ios_app` or `ios_application` targets.
        **kwargs: Common attributes (e.g. `tags`, `testonly`, `visibility`).

    `bazel build` makes the build mode of the configuration (`-c dbg` Debug,
    `-c opt --@rules_flutter//flutter:profile` Profile, otherwise Release) as
    `<name>/<Mode>/`: App.xcframework, a copy of Flutter's own engine
    xcframework, an xcframework per plugin and per code asset,
    FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework (link it; or add the
    `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h` and `.m` above the modes to the host),

    `build/ios/framework/` in the package (`-- --output=<dir>` elsewhere),
    replacing that mode's directory, so a run per mode fills `Debug/`,
    `Profile/` and `Release/`. The frameworks are built unsigned; with
    `codesign_identity` they are signed in a step of their own, as upstream
